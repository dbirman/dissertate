Notes:

Talk about the idea of trade-offs. You lose information if you change sensory representations (e.g. gorilla suit), but you don't lose information if you change read out. Put this in a starting slide at the very beginning.

In the early demos, make sure you explain the task clearly. (1) Switch happens from one exposure to the next, (2) There are two ways to attend (left vs. right). 

Put the left vs. right visual field + readout stuff much later

Don't say "one neuron" say, this is an example of a neuron that cares about gabors

Center the top tabs or have them take up more space

Readout is "what the brain does with information that it gets from its different brain sections". Introduce read out better at the start. 

I said "fit" at some point, but it didn't make sense

Black on the picture of the brain to highlight V1 needs to be emphasized earlier

Don't say "Listen" 

Introduce the idea of a sensory representation earlier

               used two related EEG signals, the readiness potential (RP) and
               the lateralized readiness potential (LRP), in order to predict
               and feed back motor intentions in real-time. In each of the
               studies, the experimental task was designed as a game that the
               subjects played against the BCI. In one of the experiments,
               subjects played a ``duel'' game against the BCI. They were
               challenged to perform spontaneous button presses but to withhold
               any movement when interrupted by a stop signal. This stop signal
               was controlled by the BCI that had been trained to predict
               movements by detecting the occurrence of RPs in the ongoing EEG.
               In the other experiment, participants played a ``matching
               pennies'' game. They won a point if they raised a different hand
               than the opponent at the end of a countdown and lost a point
               otherwise. The opponent was played by the BCI, who had been
               trained to predict from the LRP in the ongoing EEG which hand
               the subject would move at the end of the countdown. Hence, in
               both experiments a key feature of the BCI was its closed-loop
               nature, that is the ability to predict the motor intention in
               real-time and provide an immediate feedback of the prediction to
               the subject. In both experiments, prediction accuracies of the
               BCI were substantially higher compared to random predictions,
               thereby demonstrating the success of this approach. This allows
               researchers to use BCIs as research tools to address questions
               from cognitive neuroscience and provide new insights into the
               coupling of motor preparatory signals and the corresponding

              acquisitions and avoiding bias in subsequent image processing and
              analysis. Visual inspection is subjective and impractical for
              large scale datasets. Although automated quality assessments have
              been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that
              solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites.
              Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a tool
              for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary
              (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and
              as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The
              classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset
              (17 sites, N = 1102). We perform model selection evaluating
              different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at
              maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of
              76\%$\pm$13\% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out
              cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2
              sites, N = 265) also obtaining a 76\% accuracy. Even though the
              performance of the trained classifier is statistically above
              chance, we show that it is susceptible to site effects and unable
              to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs
              with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on
              unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require
              more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site

               changes the gains of neurons in visual cortex. Attention, like
               other modulatory processes, is also associated with changes in
               the extent to which pairs of neurons share trial-to-trial
               variability. We showed recently that in addition to decreasing
               correlations between similarly tuned neurons within the same
               visual area, attention increases correlations between neurons in
               primary visual cortex (V1) and the middle temporal area (MT) and
               that an extension of a classic normalization model can account
               for this correlation increase. One of the benefits of having a
               descriptive model that can account for many physiological
               observations is that it can be used to probe the mechanisms
               underlying processes such as attention. Here, we use electrical

               Consequently, any comprehensive model of biological vision must
               incorporate this attribute and provide a veritable description
               of its impact on visual perception. Current theoretical and
               computational models predict that vision should modify its
               characteristics at low contrast: for example, it should become
               broader (more lowpass) to protect from noise, as often
               demonstrated by individual neurons. We find that the opposite is
               true for human discrimination of elementary image elements:
               vision becomes sharper, not broader, as contrast approaches
               threshold levels. Furthermore, it suffers from increased
               internal variability at low contrast and it transitions from a
               surprisingly linear regime at high contrast to a markedly
               nonlinear processing mode in the low-contrast range. These
               characteristics are hard-wired in that they happen on a single
               trial without memory or expectation. Overall, the empirical
               results urge caution when attempting to interpret human vision
               from the standpoint of optimality and related theoretical
               constructs. Direct measurements of this phenomenon indicate that
               the actual constraints derive from intrinsic architectural
               features, such as the co-existence of complex-cell-like and
               simple-cell-like components. Small circuits built around these

               not appear to operate in a manner that conforms to optimality
               even approximately. More generally, our results provide a

               take serial dependencies into account, and it has been unclear
               how strongly they influence perceptual decisions. We hypothesize
               that one reason for this neglect is that there has been no
               reliable tool to quantify them and to correct for their effects.
               Here we develop a statistical method to detect, estimate, and
               correct for serial dependencies in behavioral data. We show that
               even trained psychophysical observers suffer from strong history
               dependence. A substantial fraction of the decision variance on
               difficult stimuli was independent of the stimulus but dependent

               multi-person non-invasive direct brain-to-brain interface for
               collaborative problem solving. The interface combines
               electroencephalography (EEG) to record brain signals and
               transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to deliver information
               noninvasively to the brain. The interface allows three human
               subjects to collaborate and solve a task using direct
               brain-to-brain communication. Two of the three subjects are
               designated as ``Senders'' whose brain signals are decoded using
               real-time EEG data analysis. The decoding process extracts each
               Sender's decision about whether to rotate a block in a
               Tetris-like game before it is dropped to fill a line. The
               Senders' decisions are transmitted via the Internet to the brain
               of a third subject, the ``Receiver,'' who cannot see the game
               screen. The Senders' decisions are delivered to the Receiver's
               brain via magnetic stimulation of the occipital cortex. The
               Receiver integrates the information received from the two
               Senders and uses an EEG interface to make a decision about
               either turning the block or keeping it in the same orientation.
               A second round of the game provides an additional chance for the
               Senders to evaluate the Receiver's decision and send feedback to
               the Receiver's brain, and for the Receiver to rectify a possible
               incorrect decision made in the first round. We evaluated the
               performance of BrainNet in terms of (1) Group-level performance
               during the game, (2) True/False positive rates of subjects'
               decisions, and (3) Mutual information between subjects. Five
               groups, each with three human subjects, successfully used
               BrainNet to perform the collaborative task, with an average
               accuracy of 81.25\%. Furthermore, by varying the information
               reliability of the Senders by artificially injecting noise into
               one Sender's signal, we investigated how the Receiver learns to
               integrate noisy signals in order to make a correct decision. We
               found that like conventional social networks, BrainNet allows
               Receivers to learn to trust the Sender who is more reliable, in
               this case, based solely on the information transmitted directly
               to their brains. Our results point the way to future

              Increasing the control rate significantly improved control even
              when feedback rate was unchanged. Increasing the feedback rate

               which is a central concept in ecology and measured in different
               ways. Unfortunately, quantification of specialization and
               network structure using field data can suffer from sampling
               effects. Previous studies evaluating such sampling effects
               either used field data where the true network structure is
               unknown, or they simulated sampling based on completely
               generalized interactions. Here, we used a quantitative niche
               model to generate bipartite networks representing a wide range
               of specialization and evaluated potential sampling biases for a
               large set of specialization and network metrics for different
               network sizes. We show that with sample sizes realistic for
               species-rich networks, all metrics are biased towards
               overestimating specialization (and underestimating
               generalization and niche overlap). Importantly, this sampling
               bias depends on the true degree of specialization and is
               strongest for generalized networks. We show that methods used
               for empirical data may misrepresent sampling bias: null models
               simulating generalized interactions may overestimate bias,
               whereas richness estimators may strongly overestimate sampling
               completeness. Some network metrics are barely related between
               small and large sub-samples of the same network and thus may
               often not be meaningful. Small samples also overestimate
               interspecific variation of specialization within generalized
               networks. While new approaches to deal with these challenges
               have to be developed, we also identify metrics that are
               relatively unbiased and fairly consistent across sampling
               intensities and we identify a provisional rule of thumb for the
               number of observations required for accurate estimates. Our
               quantitative niche model can help understand variation in
               network structure capturing both sampling effects and biological

               'filling-in' that underlies this phenomenon has an early or late
               cortical locus. Subjects viewed a display comprised of
               concentric rings that elicited apparent motion (two concentric
               rings presented in alternation), flicker (the same rings
               presented simultaneously), or real motion. We independently
               localized the cortical regions corresponding to the path of
               apparent motion in early visual areas (V1, V2, VP, V3, V4v,
               V3A), as well as the human motion processing complex (MT+).
               Cortical activity in the path of apparent motion in early visual
               areas was similar in amplitude during both apparent motion and
               flicker. In contrast, cortical activity in MT+ was higher in
               amplitude during apparent motion than during flicker, but was
               lower in amplitude than during real motion. In addition, we
               observed overlap in the cortical loci of MT+ and the lateral
               occipital complex (LOC), a region involved in shape and object
               processing. This overlap suggests that these regions could
               directly interact and thereby support perceived object
               continuity during apparent motion.",

               activity, with equal increases in haemodynamic signal implying
               equal increases in the underlying neuronal activity. Few studies
               have compared neuronal and haemodynamic signals in alert animals
               to test for this assumed correspondence. Here we present
               evidence that brings this assumption into question. Using a
               dual-wavelength optical imaging technique that independently
               measures cerebral blood volume and oxygenation, continuously, in
               alert behaving monkeys, we find two distinct components to the
               haemodynamic signal in the alert animals' primary visual cortex
               (V1). One component is reliably predictable from neuronal
               responses generated by visual input. The other component-of
               almost comparable strength-is a hitherto unknown signal that
               entrains to task structure independently of visual input or of
               standard neural predictors of haemodynamics. This latter
               component shows predictive timing, with increases of cerebral
               blood volume in anticipation of trial onsets even in darkness.
               This trial-locked haemodynamic signal could be due to an
               accompanying V1 arterial pumping mechanism, closely matched in
               time, with peaks of arterial dilation entrained to predicted
               trial onsets. These findings (tested in two animals) challenge
               the current understanding of the link between brain
               haemodynamics and local neuronal activity. They also suggest the
               existence of a novel preparatory mechanism in the brain that

               increases to an attended versus unattended stimulus in early

               research has either shown very small or no differences in spike

               attended stimulus. Here, fMRI was used to separately measure

              attention may act to amplify responses to all visual input, or it
              may act as a noise filter, dampening responses to irrelevant
              visual noise. Amplification allows for improved performance in

               flattened and unflattened cortical tissue was examined. A likely
               candidate for area MT (V5), which we refer to as MT, was
               demonstrated using all three stains. Myelin and CAT-301 labels
               for MT were demonstrated to be coincident by comparing results
               from the two stains in adjacent sections. In all three stains,
               MT was an oval area approximately 1.2 x 2.0 cm, located 5-6 cm
               anterior and dorsal to the foveal V1-V2 border. The position and
               size of MT as defined by the present anatomy are consistent with
               MT (V5) as defined by functional measures in humans. In
               addition, flattened cortical tissue stained for cytochrome
               oxidase revealed a distinctive staining topography in several

               anesthetized with nitrous oxide. Direction selectivity of 110 MT
               neurons was studied with three types of moving stimuli: slits,
               single spots, and random-dot fields. All of the MT neurons were
               found to be directionally selective using one or more of these
               stimuli. MT neurons exhibited a broad range of direction-tuning
               bandwidths to all stimuli (minimum = 32 degrees, maximum = 186
               degrees, mean = 95 degrees). On average, responses were strongly
               unidirectional and of similar magnitude for all three stimulus
               types. Orientation selectivity of 89 MT neurons was studied with
               stationary flashed slits. Eighty-three percent were found to be
               orientation selective. Overall, orientation-tuning bandwidths
               were significantly narrower (mean = 64 degrees) than
               direction-tuning bandwidths for moving stimuli. Moreover,
               responses to stationary-oriented stimuli were generally smaller
               than those to moving stimuli. Direction selectivity of 55 V1
               neurons was studied with moving slits; orientation selectivity
               of 52 V1 neurons was studied with stationary flashed slits. In
               V1, compared with MT, direction-tuning bandwidths were narrower
               (mean = 68 degrees). Moreover, V1 responses to moving stimuli
               were weaker, and bidirectional tuning was more common. The mean
               orientation-tuning bandwidth in V1 was also significantly
               narrower than that in MT (mean = 52 degrees), but the responses
               to stationary-oriented stimuli were of similar magnitude in the
               two areas. We examined the relationship between optimal
               direction and optimal orientation for MT neurons and found that
               61\% had an orientation preference nearly perpendicular to the
               preferred direction of motion, as is the case for all V1
               neurons. However, another 29\% of MT neurons had an orientation
               preference roughly parallel to the preferred direction. These
               observations, when considered together with recent reports
               claiming sensitivity of some MT neurons to moving visual
               patterns (39), suggest specific neural mechanisms underlying
               pattern-motion sensitivity in area MT. These results support the
               notion that area MT represents a further specialization over
               area V1 for stimulus motion processing. Furthermore, the marked

              activity are causally related to decision making. Here we address
              this question by recording and reversibly inactivating the
              lateral intraparietal (LIP) and middle temporal (MT) areas of
              rhesus macaques performing a motion direction discrimination
              task. Neurons in area LIP exhibited firing rate patterns that
              directly resembled the evidence accumulation process posited to
              govern decision making, with strong correlations between their
              response fluctuations and the animal's choices. Neurons in area
              MT, in contrast, exhibited weak correlations between their
              response fluctuations and choices, and had firing rate patterns
              consistent with their sensory role in motion encoding. The
              behavioural impact of pharmacological inactivation of each area
              was inversely related to their degree of decision-related
              activity: while inactivation of neurons in MT profoundly impaired
              psychophysical performance, inactivation in LIP had no measurable
              impact on decision-making performance, despite having silenced
              the very clusters that exhibited strong decision-related
              activity. Although LIP inactivation did not impair psychophysical
              behaviour, it did influence spatial selection and oculomotor
              metrics in a free-choice control task. The absence of an effect
              on perceptual decision making was stable over trials and sessions
              and was robust to changes in stimulus type and task geometry,
              arguing against several forms of compensation. Thus,
              decision-related signals in LIP do not appear to be critical for
              computing perceptual decisions, and may instead reflect secondary
              processes. Our findings highlight a dissociation between decision
              correlation and causation, showing that strong neuron-decision

  author    = "Ruff, Douglas A and Cohen, Marlene R",
  abstract  = "UNLABELLED: Visual attention, which improves perception of
               attended locations or objects, has long been known to affect
               many aspects of the responses of neuronal populations in visual
               cortex. There are two nonmutually exclusive hypotheses
               concerning the neuronal mechanisms that underlie these
               perceptual improvements. The first hypothesis, that attention
               improves the information encoded by a population of neurons in a
               particular cortical area, has considerable physiological
               support. The second hypothesis is that attention improves
               perception by selectively communicating relevant visual
               information. This idea has been tested primarily by measuring
               interactions between neurons on very short timescales, which are
               mathematically nearly independent of neuronal interactions on
               longer timescales. We tested the hypothesis that attention
               changes the way visual information is communicated between
               cortical areas on longer timescales by recording simultaneously
               from neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) and the middle
               temporal area (MT) in rhesus monkeys. We used two independent
               and complementary approaches. Our correlative experiment showed
               that attention increases the trial-to-trial response variability
               that is shared between the two areas. In our causal experiment,
               we electrically microstimulated V1 and found that attention
               increased the effect of stimulation on MT responses. Together,
               our results suggest that attention affects both the way visual
               stimuli are encoded within a cortical area and the extent to
               which visual information is communicated between areas on
               behaviorally relevant timescales. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Visual
               attention dramatically improves the perception of attended
               stimuli. Attention has long been thought to act by selecting
               relevant visual information for further processing. It has been
               hypothesized that this selection is accomplished by increasing
               communication between neurons that encode attended information
               in different cortical areas. We recorded simultaneously from
               neurons in primary visual cortex and the middle temporal area
               while rhesus monkeys performed an attention task. We found that
               attention increased shared variability between neurons in the
               two areas and that attention increased the effect of
               microstimulation in V1 on the firing rates of MT neurons. Our
               results provide support for the hypothesis that attention
               increases communication between neurons in different brain areas

               the average VSDI signal and the average spiking activity of
               neural populations is largely unknown. To better understand this
               relationship, we compared visual responses measured from V1 of
               behaving monkeys using VSDI and single-unit electrophysiology.
               We found large and systematic differences between position and
               orientation tuning properties obtained with these two
               techniques. We then determined that a simple computational model
               could explain these tuning differences. This model, together

               quantitative relationship between the average VSDI signal and
               local spiking activity. We found that this relationship is

               continues earlier work on orientation cues and extends it into
               the dimensions of motion and color. Tests were performed on
               patterns displaying continuous feature gradients, i.e.
               continuous variation, from element to element, in either line
               orientation, direction of motion, or color. In different series
               of experiments, the following four aspects of visual perception
               were investigated: (i) detection of a salient target (``odd man
               out'' paradigm), (ii) segmentation of texture fields, (iii)
               search strategies for given targets, and (iv) figure-ground
               discrimination by grouping. Features were, in general, not found
               to play an important role in these tasks and performance was
               instead related to feature contrast. Only in the case of color
               did performance also depend upon hue, i.e. feature properties
               themselves. Whereas in all dimensions tested pop-out
               (``saliency'') and segmentation were obtained from target or
               border elements whose local feature contrast was well above the
               level of variation elsewhere in the pattern, performance in the
               two latter tasks differed between orientation, motion, and
               color. In search, orientation targets were detected quickly when
               sufficiently distinct from their neighbors, but were apparently
               searched for serially if feature contrast was similar to that of
               other elements nearby. Color targets, however, were always
               detected fast in these patterns, independently of local feature
               contrast. Also, the perceived grouping of orientation or motion
               defined targets depended only on local feature contrast and not
               on the similarity of target elements. In fact, figures of
               dissimilar elements were seen as easily as figures of similar
               elements, indicating that, in these dimensions, stimulus
               coherence is not essential for the discrimination of figure and
               ground. For color, however, figures made up of the same targets

               focused attention is required to conjoin the separate features

               from behavioral studies of visual search, from differences in
               the ease of texture segregation, from reports of illusory
               conjunctions when attention is overloaded, from subjects'
               ability to identify simple features correctly even when they
               mislocate them, and from the substantial benefit of pre-cuing
               the location of a relevant item when the task requires that
               features be conjoined but not when simple features are
               sufficient. Some further studies of search have revealed a

               absence of the same feature is serial and requires focused
               attention. The search asymmetry can be used as an additional

  abstract  = "Detection of a visual signal requires information to reach a
               system capable of eliciting arbitrary responses required by the
               experimenter. Detection latencies are reduced when subjects
               receive a cue that indicates where in the visual field the
               signal will occur. This shift in efficiency appears to be due to
               an alignment (orienting) of the central attentional system with
               the pathways to be activated by the visual input. It would also
               be possible to describe these results as being due to a reduced
               criterion at the expected target position. However, this
               description ignores important constraints about the way in which
               expectancy improves performance. First, when subjects are cued
               on each trial, they show stronger expectancy effects than when a
               probable position is held constant for a block, indicating the
               active nature of the expectancy. Second, while information on
               spatial position improves performance, information on the form
               of the stimulus does not. Third, expectancy may lead to
               improvements in latency without a reduction in accuracy. Fourth,
               there appears to be little ability to lower the criterion at two
               positions that are not spatially contiguous. A framework
               involving the employment of a limited-capacity attentional
               mechanism seems to capture these constraints better than the
               more general language of criterion setting. Using this
               framework, we find that attention shifts are not closely related
               to the saccadic eye movement system. For luminance detection the
               retina appears to be equipotential with respect to attention
               shifts, since costs to unexpected stimuli are similar whether
               foveal or peripheral. These results appear to provide an

              discriminate either the spatial frequency or orientation of

  abstract  = "UNLABELLED: Attention is commonly thought to improve behavioral
               performance by increasing response gain and suppressing shared
               variability in neuronal populations. However, both the focus and
               the strength of attention are likely to vary from one
               experimental trial to the next, thereby inducing response
               variability unknown to the experimenter. Here we study
               analytically how fluctuations in attentional state affect the
               structure of population responses in a simple model of spatial
               and feature attention. In our model, attention acts on the
               neural response exclusively by modulating each neuron's gain.
               Neurons are conditionally independent given the stimulus and the
               attentional gain, and correlated activity arises only from
               trial-to-trial fluctuations of the attentional state, which are
               unknown to the experimenter. We find that this simple model can
               readily explain many aspects of neural response modulation under
               attention, such as increased response gain, reduced individual
               and shared variability, increased correlations with firing
               rates, limited range correlations, and differential
               correlations. We therefore suggest that attention may act
               primarily by increasing response gain of individual neurons
               without affecting their correlation structure. The
               experimentally observed reduction in correlations may instead
               result from reduced variability of the attentional gain when a
               stimulus is attended. Moreover, we show that attentional gain
               fluctuations, even if unknown to a downstream readout, do not
               impair the readout accuracy despite inducing limited-range
               correlations, whereas fluctuations of the attended feature can
               in principle limit behavioral performance. SIGNIFICANCE
               STATEMENT: Covert attention is one of the most widely studied
               examples of top-down modulation of neural activity in the visual
               system. Recent studies argue that attention improves behavioral
               performance by shaping of the noise distribution to suppress
               shared variability rather than by increasing response gain. Our
               work shows, however, that latent, trial-to-trial fluctuations of
               the focus and strength of attention lead to shared variability
               that is highly consistent with known experimental observations.
               Interestingly, fluctuations in the strength of attention do not
               affect coding performance. As a consequence, the experimentally
               observed changes in response variability may not be a mechanism
               of attention, but rather a side effect of attentional allocation
               strategies in different behavioral contexts.",

               1998. A typical scene will contain many different objects, few
               of which are relevant to behavior at any given moment. Thus
               attentional mechanisms are needed to select relevant objects for
               visual processing and control over behavior. We examined this
               role of attention in the inferior temporal cortex of macaque
               monkeys, using a visual search paradigm. While the monkey
               maintained fixation, a cue stimulus was presented at the center
               of gaze, followed by a blank delay period. After the delay, an
               array of two to five choice stimuli was presented extrafoveally,
               and the monkey was rewarded for detecting a target stimulus
               matching the cue. The behavioral response was a saccadic eye
               movement to the target in one version of the task and a lever
               release in another. The array was composed of one ``good''
               stimulus (effective in driving the cell when presented alone)
               and one or more ``poor'' stimuli (ineffective in driving the
               cell when presented alone). Most cells showed higher delay
               activity after a good stimulus used as the cue than after a poor
               stimulus. The baseline activity of cells was also higher
               preceding a good cue, if the animal expected it to occur. This
               activity may depend on a top-down bias in favor of cells coding
               the relevant stimulus. When the choice array was presented, most
               cells showed suppressive interactions between the stimuli as
               well as strong attention effects. When the choice array was
               presented in the contralateral visual field, most cells
               initially responded the same, regardless of which stimulus was
               the target. However, within 150-200 ms of array onset, responses
               were determined by the target stimulus. If the target was the
               good stimulus, the response to the array became equal to the
               response to the good stimulus presented alone. If the target was
               a poor stimulus, the response approached the response to that
               stimulus presented alone. Thus the influence of the nontarget
               stimulus was eliminated. These effects occurred well in advance
               of the behavioral response. When the array was positioned with
               stimuli on opposite sides of the vertical meridian, the
               contralateral stimulus appeared to dominate the response, and
               this dominant effect could not be overcome by attention.
               Overall, the results support a ``biased competition'' model of
               attention, according to which 1) objects in the visual field
               compete for representation in the cortex, and 2) this
               competition is biased in favor of the behaviorally relevant
               object by virtue of ``top-down'' feedback from structures

               place a single stimulus element within the receptive field of

               the directing of visual attention to the spatial location of the
               correct stimulus before its presentation. 2. The effects of
               focal attention were examined in cortical visual areas V1, V2,
               and V4, where a total of 672 neurons were isolated with complete
               studies obtained for 94 V1, 74 V2, and 74 V4 neurons with
               receptive-field center eccentricities in the range 1.8-8
               degrees. Under certain conditions, directed focal attention
               results in changes in the response of V1, V2, and V4 neurons to
               otherwise identical stimuli at spatially specific locations. 3.
               More than one-third of the neurons in each area displayed
               differential sensitivity when attention was directed toward
               versus away from the spatial location of the receptive field
               just before and during stimulus presentation. Both relative
               increases and decreases in neural activity were observed in
               association with attention directed at receptive-field stimuli.
               4. The presence of multiple competing stimuli in the visual
               field was a major factor determining the presence or absence of
               differential sensitivity. About two-thirds of the neurons that
               were differentially sensitive to the attending condition in the
               presence of competing stimuli were not differentially sensitive
               when single stimuli were presented in control studies. For V1
               and V2 neurons the presence of only a few (3-4) competing
               stimuli was sufficient for a majority of the neurons studied; a
               majority of the V4 neurons required six to eight stimuli in the
               array before significant differences between attending
               conditions occurred. 5. For V1 and V2 neurons the neuronal
               sensitivity differences between attending conditions were
               observed primarily at or near the peak of the orientation tuning
               sensitivity for each neuron; the differences were evident over a

              cellular mechanisms are poorly understood. To study the cellular

  abstract = "Many neurons in extrastriate visual cortex have large receptive
              fields, and this may lead to significant computational problems
              whenever multiple stimuli fall within a single field. Previous
              studies have suggested that when multiple stimuli fall within a
              cell's receptive field, they compete for the cell's response in a
              manner that can be biased in favor of attended stimuli. In the
              present study we examined this role of attention in areas V1, V2,
              and V4 of macaque monkeys with the use of a behavioral paradigm
              in which attention was directed to one of two stimulus locations.
              When two stimuli were presented simultaneously inside the cell's
              receptive field (which could be accomplished only in areas V2 and
              V4), we found that the cell's response was strongly influenced by
              which of the two stimuli was attended. The size of this attention
              effect was reduced when the attended and ignored stimuli were
              presented sequentially rather than simultaneously. In addition,
              the effects became very weak and inconsistent in these areas when
              only one of the two stimuli was located inside the receptive
              field. Attention thus modulated sensory responses primarily when
              two or more simultaneous stimuli competed for access to a
              neuron's receptive field. As in areas V2 and V4, attention did
              not modulate sensory responses in area V1 when only a single
              stimulus was inside the receptive field. In addition, the small
              receptive fields in this area precluded the simultaneous
              presentation of attended and ignored stimuli inside the receptive
              field, making it impossible to determine whether attention
              effects would be observed under the conditions that led to
              consistent attention effects in areas V2 and V4. Spontaneous
              firing rates in areas V2 and V4 were found to be 30-40\% higher
              when attention was directed inside rather than outside the
              receptive field, even when no stimulus was present in the
              receptive field. Spontaneous firing rates also varied according
              to the particular location within the receptive field that was
              attended. These shifts in spontaneous activity may reflect a
              top-down signal that biases responses in favor of stimuli at the
              attended location.",

               Support for this comes from studies in which subjects searched

               the subject of a large body of research in the past 15 years.
               This paper reviews the visual search literature and presents a
               model of human search behavior. Built upon the work of Neisser,
               Treisman, Julesz, and others, the model distinguishes between a
               preattentive, massively parallel stage that processes
               information about basic visual features (color, motion, various
               depth cues, etc.) across large portions of the visual field and
               a subsequent limited-capacity stage that performs other, more
               complex operations (e.g., face recognition, reading, object
               identification) over a limited portion of the visual field. The
               spatial deployment of the limited-capacity process is under
               attentional control. The heart of the guided search model is the
               idea that attentional deployment of limited resources isguided
               by the output of the earlier parallel processes. Guided Search
               2.0 (GS2) is a revision of the model in which virtually all
               aspects of the model have been made more explicit and/or revised
               in light of new data. The paper is organized into four parts:
               Part 1 presents the model and the details of its computer
               simulation. Part 2 reviews the visual search literature on
               preattentive processing of basic features and shows how the GS2
               simulation reproduces those results. Part 3 reviews the
               literature on the attentional deployment of limited-capacity
               processes in conjunction and serial searches and shows how the
               simulation handles those conditions. Finally, Part 4 deals with

              vision-optical quality and cone density-contribute to performance
              differences with polar angle, we created a computational observer
              model. The model uses the open-source software package ISETBIO to
              simulate an orientation discrimination task for which visual
              performance differs with polar angle. The model starts from the
              photons emitted by a display, which pass through simulated human
              optics with fixational eye movements, followed by cone
              isomerizations in the retina. Finally, we classify stimulus
              orientation using a support vector machine to learn a linear
              classifier on the photon absorptions. To account for the 30\%
              increase in contrast thresholds for upper vertical compared to
              horizontal meridian, as observed psychophysically on the same
              task, our computational observer model would require either an
              increase of ~7 diopters of defocus or a reduction of 500\% in
              cone density. These values far exceed the actual variations as a
              function of polar angle observed in human eyes. Therefore, we
              conclude that these factors in the eye only account for a small
              fraction of differences in visual performance with polar angle.
              Substantial additional asymmetries must arise in later retinal
              and/or cortical processing.",

               called a preferred direction (when motor) or a receptive field
               (when sensory). As we previously reported, some neurons in the
               monkey prefrontal cortex are tuned to two parts of space, which
               we interpreted as reflecting attention and working memory,
               respectively. Monkeys performed a behavioral task in which they
               attended to a visual stimulus at one location while remembering
               a second place, and these locations were varied from trial to
               trial to assess spatial tuning. Most spatially tuned neurons
               specialized in either attentional or mnemonic processing, but
               about one-third of the cells showed tuning for both. Here, we

               usually differ (and often diametrically oppose one another), (2)
               they have stronger tuning than specialized cells, and (3) pairs

               initiates biases in the strength of visual representations.
               Recent evidence argues that, during spatial attention, these
               biases reflect nascent saccadic eye movement commands. We
               examined the functional interaction of saccade preparation and
               visual coding by electrically stimulating sites within the
               frontal eye fields (FEF) and measuring its effect on the
               activity of neurons in extrastriate visual cortex. Here we show
               that visual responses in area V4 could be enhanced after brief
               stimulation of retinotopically corresponding sites within the
               FEF using currents below that needed to evoke saccades. The
               magnitude of the enhancement depended on the effectiveness of
               receptive field stimuli as well as on the presence of competing
               stimuli outside the receptive field. Stimulation of
               non-corresponding FEF representations could suppress V4

               response of neurons in the visual cortex to attended stimuli.
               However, recent results show that the superior colliculus (SC),

  abstract  = "1. The striate cortex was studied in lightly anaesthetized
               macaque and spider monkeys by recording extracellularly from
               single units and stimulating the retinas with spots or patterns
               of light. Most cells can be categorized as simple, complex, or
               hypercomplex, with response properties very similar to those
               previously described in the cat. On the average, however,
               receptive fields are smaller, and there is a greater sensitivity
               to changes in stimulus orientation. A small proportion of the
               cells are colour coded.2. Evidence is presented for at least two
               independent systems of columns extending vertically from surface
               to white matter. Columns of the first type contain cells with
               common receptive-field orientations. They are similar to the
               orientation columns described in the cat, but are probably
               smaller in cross-sectional area. In the second system cells are
               aggregated into columns according to eye preference. The ocular
               dominance columns are larger than the orientation columns, and
               the two sets of boundaries seem to be independent.3. There is a
               tendency for cells to be grouped according to symmetry of
               responses to movement; in some regions the cells respond equally
               well to the two opposite directions of movement of a line, but
               other regions contain a mixture of cells favouring one direction
               and cells favouring the other.4. A horizontal organization
               corresponding to the cortical layering can also be discerned.
               The upper layers (II and the upper two-thirds of III) contain
               complex and hypercomplex cells, but simple cells are virtually
               absent. The cells are mostly binocularly driven. Simple cells
               are found deep in layer III, and in IV A and IV B. In layer IV B
               they form a large proportion of the population, whereas complex
               cells are rare. In layers IV A and IV B one finds units lacking
               orientation specificity; it is not clear whether these are cell
               bodies or axons of geniculate cells. In layer IV most cells are
               driven by one eye only; this layer consists of a mosaic with
               cells of some regions responding to one eye only, those of other
               regions responding to the other eye. Layers V and VI contain
               mostly complex and hypercomplex cells, binocularly driven.5. The
               cortex is seen as a system organized vertically and horizontally
               in entirely different ways. In the vertical system (in which
               cells lying along a vertical line in the cortex have common

               difference between them was the modality of the two-choice
               responses. The continuous task was performed significantly worse
               when the two-choice responses were manual. The probability of
               response production on the continuous task was affected by the
               production of manual responses but not by the production of
               vocal responses. It was concluded that although the two manual

               the manual and vocal responses were produced by independent
               processes. In Experiment II the same manual tracking task was

              constant rate of errors independent of evidence strength,
              referred to as lapses. Their proper treatment is crucial for
              accurate estimation of perceptual parameters, however they are
              often treated as a nuisance arising from motor errors or
              inattention. Here, we propose that lapses can instead reflect a
              dynamic form of exploration. We demonstrate that perceptual
              uncertainty modulates the probability of lapses both across and
              within modalities on a multisensory discrimination task in rats.
              These effects cannot be accounted for by inattention or motor
              error, however they are concisely explained by uncertainty-guided
              exploration. We confirm the predictions of the exploration model
              by showing that changing the magnitude or probability of reward
              associated with one of the decisions selectively affects the
              lapses associated with that decision in uncertain conditions,
              while leaving sure-bet decisions unchanged, as predicted by the
              model. Finally, we demonstrate that muscimol inactivations of
              secondary motor cortex and posterior striatum affect lapses
              asymmetrically across modalities. The inactivations can be
              captured by a devaluation of actions corresponding to the
              inactivated side, and do not affect sure-bet decisions. Together,

               locomotion enhances visual responses in mouse primary visual
               cortex (V1), resembling the effects of spatial attention on

               irrelevant distracters and has been extensively studied in human
               and non-human primate subjects. Mice have emerged as a powerful
               animal model for studying aspects of the visual system but have
               not yet been shown to exhibit visual selective attention.
               Differences in the organization of the visual systems of
               primates and mice raise the possibility that selective visual
               attention might not be present in mice, at least not in the
               forms that are well established in primates. Here, we tested for
               selective visual attention in mice by using three behavioral
               paradigms adapted from classic studies of attention. In a
               Posner-style cueing task, a spatial cue indicated the probable
               location of the relevant visual event, and we found that
               accuracy was higher and reaction times were shorter on validly
               cued trials. In a cue versus no-cue task, an informative spatial
               cue was provided on half the trials, and mice had higher

               lower detection thresholds measured from psychometric curves. In
               a filter task, the spatial cue indicated the location of the
               relevant visual event, and we found that mice could be trained
               to ignore irrelevant but otherwise identical visual events at
               uncued locations. Together, these results demonstrate that mice

               V1 of two rhesus monkeys. The animals were trained to perform a
               delayed match-to-sample task in which oriented stimuli were
               presented in the receptive field of the neuron being recorded.
               On some trials the animals were instructed to pay attention to

  author    = "Miconi, Thomas and VanRullen, Rufin",
  abstract  = "Visual attention has many effects on neural responses, producing
               complex changes in firing rates, as well as modifying the
               structure and size of receptive fields, both in topological and
               feature space. Several existing models of attention suggest that
               these effects arise from selective modulation of neural inputs.
               However, anatomical and physiological observations suggest that
               attentional modulation targets higher levels of the visual
               system (such as V4 or MT) rather than input areas (such as V1).
               Here we propose a simple mechanism that explains how a top-down
               attentional modulation, falling on higher visual areas, can
               produce the observed effects of attention on neural responses.
               Our model requires only the existence of modulatory feedback
               connections between areas, and short-range lateral inhibition
               within each area. Feedback connections redistribute the top-down
               modulation to lower areas, which in turn alters the inputs of
               other higher-area cells, including those that did not receive
               the initial modulation. This produces firing rate modulations
               and receptive field shifts. Simultaneously, short-range lateral
               inhibition between neighboring cells produce competitive effects
               that are automatically scaled to receptive field size in any
               given area. Our model reproduces the observed attentional
               effects on response rates (response gain, input gain, biased
               competition automatically scaled to receptive field size) and
               receptive field structure (shifts and resizing of receptive
               fields both spatially and in complex feature space), without
               modifying model parameters. Our model also makes the novel
               prediction that attentional effects on response curves should
               shift from response gain to contrast gain as the spatial focus
               of attention drifts away from the studied cell.",

              brief exposure. Lettered stimuli were chosen because these
              contain a relatively large amount of information per item and
              because these are the kind of stimuli that have been used by most
              previous investigators. The first two experiments are essentially
              control experiments; they attempt to confirm that
              immediate-memory for letters is independent of the parameters of
              stimulation, that it is an individual characteristic. In the
              third experiment the number of letters available immediately
              after the extinction of the stimulus is determined by means of a
              sampling (partial report) procedure described. The fourth
              experiment explores decay of available information with time. The
              fifth experiment examines some exposure parameters. In the sixth
              experiment a technique which fails to demonstrate a large amount

              deals with the role of the historically important variable: order

              only a limited number of symbols correctly. For exposure
              durations from 15 to 500 msec, the average was slightly over four
              letters; stimuli having four or fewer letters were reported

              high accuracy of partial report observed in the experiments does
              not depend on the order of report or on the position of letters
              on the stimulus, but rather it is shown to depend on the ability
              of the observer to read a visual image that persists for a

               perception has sometimes been cast as a process of inference,
               whereby sensory inputs are combined with prior knowledge.
               However, despite a wealth of behavioral literature supporting an
               account of perception as probabilistic inference, the neural
               mechanisms underlying this process remain largely unknown. One
               important question is whether top-down expectation biases
               stimulus representations in early sensory cortex, i.e., whether
               the integration of prior knowledge and bottom-up inputs is
               already observable at the earliest levels of sensory processing.
               Alternatively, early sensory processing may be unaffected by
               top-down expectations, and integration of prior knowledge and
               bottom-up input may take place in downstream association areas
               that are proposed to be involved in perceptual decision-making.
               Here, we implicitly manipulated human subjects' prior
               expectations about visual motion stimuli, and probed the effects
               on both perception and sensory representations in visual cortex.
               To this end, we measured neural activity noninvasively using
               functional magnetic resonance imaging, and applied a forward
               modeling approach to reconstruct the motion direction of the
               perceived stimuli from the signal in visual cortex. Our results

              contrast, coherence, and stimulus durations as we measured
              blood-oxygen-level dependent responses. We developed a framework
              for modeling these responses which quantifies their functional
              form and sensitivity across areas. Our framework demonstrates the
              sensitivity of all visual areas to each parameter, with early
              visual areas V1-V4 showing more parametric sensitivity to changes
              in contrast and V3A and MT to coherence. Our results suggest that
              while motion contrast, coherence, and duration share cortical
              representation, they are encoded with distinct functional forms
              and sensitivity. Thus, our quantitative framework serves as a
              reference for interpretation of the vast perceptual literature
              manipulating these parameters and shows that different
              manipulations of visibility will have different effects across
              human visual cortex and need to be interpreted accordingly.",

  abstract  = "Ventral temporal cortex (VTC) is the latest stage of the ventral
               ``what'' visual pathway, which is thought to code the identity
               of a stimulus regardless of its position or size [1, 2].
               Surprisingly, recent studies show that position information can
               be decoded from VTC [3-5]. However, the computational mechanisms
               by which spatial information is encoded in VTC are unknown.
               Furthermore, how attention influences spatial representations in
               human VTC is also unknown because the effect of attention on
               spatial representations has only been examined in the dorsal
               ``where'' visual pathway [6-10]. Here, we fill these significant
               gaps in knowledge using an approach that combines functional
               magnetic resonance imaging and sophisticated computational
               methods. We first develop a population receptive field (pRF)
               model [11, 12] of spatial responses in human VTC. Consisting of
               spatial summation followed by a compressive nonlinearity, this
               model accurately predicts responses of individual voxels to
               stimuli at any position and size, explains how spatial
               information is encoded, and reveals a functional hierarchy in
               VTC. We then manipulate attention and use our model to decipher
               the effects of attention. We find that attention to the stimulus
               systematically and selectively modulates responses in VTC, but
               not early visual areas. Locally, attention increases
               eccentricity, size, and gain of individual pRFs, thereby
               increasing position tolerance. However, globally, these effects
               reduce uncertainty regarding stimulus location and actually
               increase position sensitivity of distributed responses across
               VTC. These results demonstrate that attention actively shapes

               estimates of the external parameters that define the appropriate
               action. For tasks in which precision is at a premium,
               performance would be optimal if no noise were added in movement

               testing ground for this notion of optimality. In response to
               repeated presentations of identical target motions, nearly 92\%

  abstract  = "We have examined the idea that the adaptation of cortical
               neurons to local contrast levels in a visual stimulus is
               functionally advantageous. Specifically, cortical cells may have
               large differential contrast sensitivity as a result of
               adjustments that center a limited response range around a mean
               level of contrast. To evaluate this notion, we measured
               contrast-response functions of cells in striate cortex while
               systematically adapting them to different contrast levels of
               stimulus gratings. For the majority of cortical neurons tested,
               the results of this basic experiment show that contrast-response
               functions shift laterally along a log-contrast axis so that
               response functions match mean contrast levels in the stimulus.
               This implies a contrast-dependent change in the gain of the
               cell's contrast-response relationship. We define this process as
               contrast gain control. The degree to which this contrast
               adjustment occurs varies considerably from cell to cell. There
               are no obvious differences regarding cell type (simple vs.
               complex) or laminar distribution. Contrast gain control is
               almost certainly a cortical function, since lateral geniculate
               cells and fibers exhibit only minimal effects. Tests presented
               in the accompanying paper (37) provide additional evidence on
               the cortical origin of the process. In another series of
               experiments, the effect of contrast adaptation on physiological
               estimates of contrast sensitivity was evaluated. Sustained
               adaptation to contrast levels as low as 3\% was capable of
               nearly doubling the thresholds of most of the cells tested.
               Adaptation may therefore be an important factor in
               determinations of the contrast sensitivity of cortical neurons.
               We tested the spatial extent of the mechanisms responsible for
               these gain-control effects by attempting to adapt cells using
               both a large grating and a grating patch limited to that portion
               of a cell's receptive field from which excitatory discharges
               could be elicited directly (the central discharge region).
               Adaptation was found to be an exclusive property of the central
               region. This held even in the case of hypercomplex cells, which
               received strong influences from surrounding regions of the
               visual field. Finally, we measured the time course of contrast
               adaptation. We found the process to be rather slow, with a mean
               time constant of approximately 6 s. Once again, there was
               considerable variability in this value from cell to cell.",

               if the effects of adaptation to different contrast levels are
               more extensive than those in adult animals. Our experiments
               involved adapting cells to different contrasts (3.1, 12.5, and
               50\%) while concurrently measuring their contrast-response
               functions at each of these different levels. We found
               qualitatively that the effects of adaptation in the kitten are
               similar to those we have previously documented in adult animals
               (19). Contrast-response functions are laterally shifted along
               the log-contrast axis, effectively matching the response range
               of the cells to prevailing contrast levels. The degree to which
               this occurred varied from cell to cell. The average degree to

               of age. Additional studies were undertaken with the intent of
               localizing these adaptive effects. First, lateral geniculate

               the target appears reduced in contrast and is harder to detect,

               functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and psychophysics
               to quantitatively compare these physiological and perceptual
               effects. Observers performed a contrast discrimination task on a

               represent categories as locations in a continuous semantic space
               mapped smoothly across the cortical surface. To search for such
               a space, we used fMRI to measure human brain activity evoked by
               natural movies. We then used voxelwise models to examine the
               cortical representation of 1,705 object and action categories.
               The first few dimensions of the underlying semantic space were
               recovered from the fit models by principal components analysis.
               Projection of the recovered semantic space onto cortical flat
               maps shows that semantic selectivity is organized into smooth
               gradients that cover much of visual and nonvisual cortex.
               Furthermore, both the recovered semantic space and the cortical

               DeepFix, a fully convolutional neural network, which models the
               bottom-up mechanism of visual attention via saliency prediction.
               Unlike classical works, which characterize the saliency map
               using various hand-crafted features, our model automatically
               learns features in a hierarchical fashion and predicts the
               saliency map in an end-to-end manner. DeepFix is designed to
               capture semantics at multiple scales while taking global context
               into account, by using network layers with very large receptive
               fields. Generally, fully convolutional nets are spatially
               invariant-this prevents them from modeling location-dependent
               patterns (e.g., centre-bias). Our network handles this by
               incorporating a novel location-biased convolutional layer. We
               evaluate our model on multiple challenging saliency data sets

               in short-term storage of recently encoded information about
               stimulus motion. We used a behavioral task in which monkeys
               compared the directions of two moving random-dot stimuli, sample
               and test, separated by a 1.5-s delay. Four sample directions
               were used for each site, and the animals had to indicate whether
               the direction of motion in the sample was the same as or
               different to the direction of motion in the test. We found that
               the effect of stimulation of the same directional column in MT
               depended on the behavioral state of the animal. Although
               stimulation had strong effects when applied during the encoding
               and the storage components of the task, these effects were not
               equivalent. Stimulation applied during the presentation of the
               sample produced signals interpreted by the monkeys as
               directional motion. However, the same stimulation introduced
               during the period of storage no longer produced signals
               interpreted as unambiguous directional information. We conclude
               that the directional information used by the monkeys in the

               and the use of this information appears to be dependent on the
               portion of the task during which stimulation was delivered.
               Finally, the disruptive effects of stimulation during the delay
               suggest that MT neurons not only participate in the encoding of
               visual motion information but also in its storage by either
               maintaining an active connection with the circuitry involved in

               often distorted by prevailing conditions. For instance, as
               luminance is reduced, our perception of the speed of fast-moving
               patterns can be increased by as much as 30\%. To investigate how
               the cortical representation of speed may vary under such

               level-dependent (BOLD) response of visual cortex to drifting
               sine gratings at two very different luminances. The average BOLD
               response in all areas was band-pass with respect to speed (or
               equivalently, temporal frequency) and thus contained no
               unambiguous speed information. However, a multivariate
               classifier was able to predict grating speed successfully in all

              activity that precedes the onset of a sensory stimulus. Using
              functional MRI (fMRI), we studied how neural mechanisms that
              mediate spatial attention affect the accuracy of a motion
              discrimination judgment. The amplitude of blood oxygen
              level-dependent (BOLD) signals after a cue directing spatial
              attention predicted subjects' accuracy on 60-75\% of the trials.
              Widespread predictive signals, which included dorsal parietal,

              depended on whether the cue correctly specified the stimulus

              V5/MT with fMRI in terms of specificity to optic flow stimuli, a
              key characteristic of macaque MST. Stimuli were large fields of
              moving dots, forming coherent global flow patterns. Random motion
              was used as a control. Retinotopic mapping was also conducted.
              The previously suggested existence of at least two distinct
              sub-regions, MT and MST, within the V5/MT complex was confirmed.
              Human MT is activated about equally by all moving dot patterns,
              including random motion, suggesting that it has little
              sensitivity to global flow structure. As previously described,
              this region shows strong signs of retinotopic organization and is
              only weakly activated by stimuli confined to the ipsilateral
              hemifield. In human MST, located immediately anterior to MT and
              strongly driven by ipsilateral stimuli, activation varies
              markedly with optic flow structure. The strongest activation is
              produced by complex flow that contains multiple flow components

               responses, often linked to perception, which are heavily
               influenced by its rich connectivity with the primary visual
               cortex (V1). This human motion area also receives a number of
               inputs from other visual regions, including direct subcortical
               connections and callosal connections with the contralateral
               hemisphere. Little is currently known about such alternative
               inputs to V5/MT+ and how they may drive and influence its
               activity. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the
               response of human V5/MT+ to increasing the proportion of
               coherent motion was measured in seven patients with unilateral
               V1 damage acquired during adulthood, and a group of healthy
               age-matched controls. When V1 was damaged, the typical V5/MT+
               response to increasing coherence was lost. Rather, V5/MT+ in
               patients showed a negative trend with coherence that was similar
               to coherence-related activity in V1 of healthy control subjects.
               This shift to a response-pattern more typical of early visual
               cortex suggests that in the absence of V1, V5/MT+ activity may
               be shaped by similar direct subcortical input. This is likely to
               reflect intact residual pathways rather than a change in
               connectivity, and has important implications for blindsight
               function. It also confirms predictions that V1 is critically
               involved in normal V5/MT+ global motion processing, consistent
               with a convergent model of V1 input to V5/MT+. Historically,
               most attempts to model cortical visual responses do not consider
               the contribution of direct subcortical inputs that may bypass
               striate cortex, such as input to V5/MT+. We have shown that the
               signal change driven by these non-striate pathways can be
               measured, and suggest that models of the intact visual system

              speed tuning using steps to constant speeds and acceleration and
              deceleration tuning using speed ramps. The results show that the
              speed tuning of neurons in all three cortical areas is highly
              dependent on prior motion history, with early responses during
              speed steps tuned to higher speeds than later responses. The
              responses to speed ramps are profoundly influenced by
              speed-dependent response latencies and ongoing changes in
              neuronal speed tuning due to adaptation. Acceleration evokes
              larger transient and sustained responses than subsequent
              deceleration of the same rate with this disparity increasing with
              ramp rate. Consequently, there was little correlation between
              preferred speeds measured using speed steps, acceleration or
              deceleration. From 146 recorded cells, the proportion of cells
              that were clearly speed tuned ranged from 69 to 100\% across the
              three brain areas. However, only 13 cells showed good skewed
              Gaussian fits and systematic variation in their responses to a
              range of accelerations. Although suggestive of acceleration
              coding, this apparent tuning was attributable to a cell's speed
              tuning and the different stimulus durations at each acceleration
              rate. Thus while the majority of cells showed speed tuning, none
              unequivocally showed acceleration tuning. The results are largely
              consistent with an existing model that predicts responses to
              accelerating stimuli developed for macaque MT, which showed that
              the responses to acceleration can be decoded if adaptation is
              taken into account. However, the present results suggest future

              almost all simple cells in V1 had responses that were separable
              for spatial and temporal frequency: the preferred temporal
              frequency did not change and preferred speed decreased as a
              function of the spatial frequency of the grating. As in previous
              recordings from the middle temporal visual area (MT),
              approximately one-quarter of V1 complex cells had separable
              responses to spatial and temporal frequency, and one-quarter were
              ``speed tuned'' in the sense that preferred speed did not change
              as a function of spatial frequency. Half fell between these two
              extremes. Reducing the contrast of the gratings caused the
              population of V1 complex cells to become more separable in their
              tuning for spatial and temporal frequency. Contrast dependence is
              explained by the contrast gain of the neurons, which was
              relatively higher for gratings that were either both of high or
              both of low temporal and spatial frequency. For stimuli that
              comprised two spatially superimposed sine-wave gratings, the
              preferred speeds and tuning bandwidths of V1 neurons could be
              predicted from the sum of the responses to the component gratings
              presented alone, unlike neurons in MT that showed nonlinear
              interactions. We conclude that spatiotemporal modulation of
              contrast gain creates speed tuning from separable inputs in V1
              complex cells. Speed tuning in MT could be primarily inherited
              from V1, but processing that occurs after V1 and possibly within
              MT computes selective combinations of speed-tuned signals of
              special relevance for downstream perceptual and motor mechanisms.",

               cognition in the context of simple laboratory tasks and begun to
               attack the problem of modeling it in more complex, realistic
               environments, such as those studied by researchers in the field
               of human factors. The problems that the cognitive modeling
               community is tackling focus on modeling certain problems of
               communication and control that arise when integrating with the
               external environment factors such as implicit and explicit
               knowledge, emotion, cognition, and the cognitive system. These
               problems must be solved in order to produce integrated cognitive
               models of moderately complex tasks. Architectures of cognition
               in these tasks focus on the control of a central system, which
               includes control of the central processor itself, initiation of
               functional processes, such as visual search and memory
               retrieval, and harvesting the results of these functional
               processes. Because the control of the central system is
               conceptually different from the internal control required by
               individual functional processes, a complete architecture of
               cognition must incorporate two types of theories of control:
               Type 1 theories of the structure, functionality, and operation
               of the controller, and type 2 theories of the internal control
               of functional processes, including how and what they communicate
               to the controller. This book presents the current state of the
               art for both types of theories, as well as contrasts among
               current approaches to human-performance models. It will be an
               important resource for professional and student researchers in

               STATEMENTVisual working memory (VWM) capacity predicts
               performance on a wide array of cognitive and real-world
               outcomes. At least two theoretically distinct factors are
               proposed to influence VWM capacity limitations: an amodal
               attentional resource that must be shared across remembered
               items, and the demands on context binding. We unconfounded these
               two factors by varying load with items drawn from the same
               stimulus category (``high demands on context binding'') versus
               items drawn from different stimulus categories (``low demands on
               context binding''). The results provide evidence for the
               dissociability, and the neural bases, of these two theorized
               factors, and they specify that the functions of intraparietal
               sulcus may relate more strongly to the control of
               representations than to the general allocation of attention.",

              the reliability of sensory coding. However, it could also be due

              relative contributions of these sources are unknown. We addressed
              this by recording from populations of V1 neurons in macaques

              processing need not apply. Furthermore, we show that correlations

              resonance imaging (MRI), a non-invasive, spatially-resolved
              technique for measuring brain activity, provided a wealth of data
              about human retinotopic maps. Just as there are differences
              amongst non-human primate maps, the human maps have their own
              unique properties. Many human maps can be measured reliably in
              individual subjects during experimental sessions lasting less
              than an hour. The efficiency of the measurements and the
              relatively large amplitude of functional MRI signals in visual

              functional responses within specific maps in individual subjects.

              to 800 ms after appearance. These results demonstrate that LIP is
              involved in neural time integration underlying the accumulation

              decision-related LIP responses, as well as behavioral choices and

               made. Therefore, when a directionally selective neuron in area
               MT fires more vigorously, the monkey is more likely to make a
               decision in favor of the preferred direction of the cell. The
               magnitude of the relationship was modest, on average, but was
               highly significant across a sample of 299 cells from four
               monkeys. The relationship was present for all stimuli (including
               those without a net motion signal), and for all but the weakest
               responses. The relationship was reduced or eliminated when the
               demands of the task were changed so that the directional signal
               carried by the cell was less informative. The relationship was
               evident within 50 ms of response onset, and persisted throughout
               the stimulus presentation. On average, neurons that were more

               used by the monkey to determine the direction of stimulus
               motion. The modest relationship between behavioral choice and
               the discharge of any one neuron, and the prevalence of the

               reported for an ambiguous visual stimulus (Hesselmann et al.,
               2008). To test whether this result generalizes from the visual
               object domain to other perceptual and neural systems, the
               current study investigated the effect of ongoing signal
               fluctuations in motion-sensitive brain regions on the perception
               of coherent visual motion. We determined motion coherence
               thresholds individually for each subject using a dynamic random
               dot display. During functional magnetic resonance imaging
               (fMRI), brief events of subliminal, supraliminal, and
               periliminal coherent motion were presented with long and
               variable interstimulus intervals between them. On each trial,
               subjects reported whether they had perceived ``coherent'' or
               ``random'' motion, and fMRI signal time courses were analyzed
               separately as a function of stimulus and percept type. In the
               right motion-sensitive occipito-temporal cortex (hMT+), coherent
               percepts of periliminal stimuli yielded a larger stimulus-evoked
               response than random percepts. Prestimulus baseline activity in
               this region was also significantly higher in these coherent
               trials than in random trials. As in our previous study, however,
               the relation between ongoing and evoked activity was not
               additive but interacted with perceptual outcome. Our data thus
               suggest that endogenous fluctuations in baseline activity have a

               mainstream analytical techniques used in functional neuroimaging

              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have decoded
              orientation, position and object category from activity in visual
              cortex. However, these studies typically used relatively simple
              stimuli (for example, gratings) or images drawn from fixed
              categories (for example, faces, houses), and decoding was based
              on previous measurements of brain activity evoked by those same
              stimuli or categories. To overcome these limitations, here we
              develop a decoding method based on quantitative receptive-field
              models that characterize the relationship between visual stimuli
              and fMRI activity in early visual areas. These models describe
              the tuning of individual voxels for space, orientation and
              spatial frequency, and are estimated directly from responses
              evoked by natural images. We show that these receptive-field

              completely novel natural images, which specific image was seen by

               the perceptual properties of face recognition such as tolerance
               to changes in the size and contrast of the face, the effects of
               alteration of the size and contrast of an effective face
               stimulus on the responses of these neurons were analysed
               quantitatively in macaque monkeys. First, it was shown that the
               majority of these neurons had responses which were relatively
               invariant with respect to the size of the stimulus. The median
               size change tolerated with a response of greater than half the
               maximal response was 12 times. Second, it was found that for a
               few of these neurons, the size of the face did affect the
               neuronal response. For most of these neurons, it was found that
               when the size of the image and its distance were altered, the
               neuronal response was related to the retinal angle subtended by
               the image. But for four neurons the absolute size of the image
               determined the magnitude of the neuronal response, independently
               of the distance of the image. Thus these four neurons showed
               size constancy. It is suggested that these neurons would be
               useful as part of a face recognition system, because only
               objects in a certain absolute size range should normally be
               classified as faces. Third, the responses of the neurons were
               relatively invariant with respect to the contrast of the face.
               The mean contrast at which the neurons still responded with more
               than half the maximal response was 0.26. Fourth, the responses
               of the neurons were relatively invariant with respect to the
               sign of the contrast of the face, that is the neurons responded
               to negative as well as to positive images of faces. Fifth, the
               neurons typically responded to a face when the information in it
               had been reduced from 3D to a 2D representation in gray on a
               monitor, with a response which was on average 0.5 that to a real
               face. These results show that the responses of these neurons
               have some of the invariant properties with respect to size and
               contrast alteration shown by face perception, and show that
               their processing is at a level which would be useful in face
               recognition.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

              and stimulus length and the sensitivity to luminance contrast
              between the two areas. 2. V4 cells were as selective as MT cells
              for speed. The sharpness of tuning was not different between the
              two populations. The optimal speed varied widely in both areas,

              cells (45\% in V4 and 48\% in MT) showed inhibition by long (16

               signal responses averaged over a region of interest have
               demonstrated that the response is nonlinear with respect to

               produce signal changes larger than expected from a linear
               system. The focus of this study is to characterize the spatial
               heterogeneity of this nonlinear effect. A series of MR images of

               fitting ideal linear responses to the responses at each SD. This
               amplitude, which is constant for different SD in a linear
               system, was normalized by the amplitude of the response to a

               milliseconds. The approach is based on the close relationship
               between neuronal electrical events and fMRI signal that is
               experimentally demonstrated in concurrent fMRI and
               electroencephalographic (EEG) studies conducted in a rat model

               period of neuronal origin in a two-stimuli paradigm: the first

               fMRI signal responding to the subsequent stimulus for a period
               of several hundred milliseconds. When there was an apparent
               site-site interaction detected in the evoked EEG signal induced
               by two stimuli that were primarily targeted to activate two

              been demonstrated on single-site datasets, it is unclear that
              solutions can generalize to unseen data acquired at new sites.
              Here, we introduce the MRI Quality Control tool (MRIQC), a tool
              for extracting quality measures and fitting a binary
              (accept/exclude) classifier. Our tool can be run both locally and
              as a free online service via the OpenNeuro.org portal. The
              classifier is trained on a publicly available, multi-site dataset
              (17 sites, N = 1102). We perform model selection evaluating
              different normalization and feature exclusion approaches aimed at
              maximizing across-site generalization and estimate an accuracy of
              76\%$\pm$13\% on new sites, using leave-one-site-out
              cross-validation. We confirm that result on a held-out dataset (2

              to account for artifacts specific to new sites. MRIQC performs
              with high accuracy in intra-site prediction, but performance on
              unseen sites leaves space for improvement which might require
              more labeled data and new approaches to the between-site

              orientation discrimination (Experiments 1-4), detection

              discriminated the direction of motion in random-dot visual
              stimuli. The visual task was similar to a motion discrimination
              task that has been used in previous investigations of
              motion-sensitive regions of the extrastriate cortex. The monkeys
              were trained to decide whether the direction of motion was toward
              one of two choice targets that appeared on either side of the
              random-dot stimulus. At the end of the trial, the monkeys
              reported their direction judgment by making an eye movement to
              the appropriate target. We studied neurons in LIP that exhibited
              spatially selective persistent activity during delayed saccadic
              eye movement tasks. These neurons are thought to carry high-level
              signals appropriate for identifying salient visual targets and
              for guiding saccadic eye movements. We arranged the motion
              discrimination task so that one of the choice targets was in the
              LIP neuron's response field (RF) while the other target was
              positioned well away from the RF. During motion viewing, neurons
              in LIP altered their firing rate in a manner that predicted the
              saccadic eye movement that the monkey would make at the end of
              the trial. The activity thus predicted the monkey's judgment of
              motion direction. This predictive activity began early in the
              motion-viewing period and became increasingly reliable as the
              monkey viewed the random-dot motion. The neural activity
              predicted the monkey's direction judgment on both easy and
              difficult trials (strong and weak motion), whether or not the
              judgment was correct. In addition, the timing and magnitude of
              the response was affected by the strength of the motion signal in
              the stimulus. When the direction of motion was toward the RF,
              stronger motion led to larger neural responses earlier in the
              motion-viewing period. When motion was away from the RF, stronger
              motion led to greater suppression of ongoing activity. Thus the
              activity of single neurons in area LIP reflects both the
              direction of an impending gaze shift and the quality of the
              sensory information that instructs such a response. The time
              course of the neural response suggests that LIP accumulates
              sensory signals relevant to the selection of a target for an eye
              movement.",

              activation during viewing of coherently moving random dots with
              that during viewing spatially and temporally comparable dynamic
              noise. Rates of reversal of coherent motion and coherent-motion
              velocities (5 versus 20 deg s-1) were also compared. Differences
              in local activation between conditions were analysed by
              statistical parametric mapping. Greater activation by coherent
              motion compared to noise was found in V5 and putative V3A, but

               quantitative estimates of neuronal responses with this new

               time-course of the fMRI response varied with stimulus timing and
               strength. The results ended up showing strong evidence that to a
               first approximation the hemodynamic transformation was linear in

               nearly all fMRI data analysis techniques assume or require
               linearity, and remarkable because the physiological basis of the

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Attending to the spatial location or to nonspatial
              features of visual stimuli can modulate neuronal responses in
              primate visual cortex. The modulation by spatial attention
              changes the gain of sensory neurons and strengthens the
              representation of attended locations without changing neuronal
              selectivities such as directionality, i.e., the ratio of
              responses to preferred and anti-preferred directions of motion.
              Whether feature-based attention acts in a similar manner is
              unknown. RESULTS: To clarify this issue, we recorded the
              responses of 135 direction-selective neurons in the middle
              temporal area (MT) of two macaques to an unattended moving random
              dot pattern (the distractor) positioned inside a neuron's
              receptive field while the animals attended to a second moving
              pattern positioned in the opposite hemifield. Responses to
              different directions of the distractor were modulated by the same
              factor (approximately 12\%) as long as the attended direction
              remained unchanged. On the other hand, systematically changing
              the attended direction from a neuron's preferred to its
              anti-preferred direction caused a systematic change of the
              attentional modulation from an enhancement to a suppression,
              increasing directionality by about 20\%. CONCLUSIONS: The results
              show that (1) feature-based attention exerts a multiplicative
              modulation upon neuronal responses and that the strength of this
              modulation depends on the similarity between the attended feature
              and the cell's preferred feature, in line with the
              feature-similarity gain model, and (2) at the level of the
              neuronal population, feature-based attention increases the
              selectivity for attended features by increasing the responses of
              neurons preferring this feature value while decreasing responses

              search performance in monkeys, despite the fact that much of our
              understanding of the neural mechanisms of attention is based on
              these animals. In this study, we characterize the covert visual
              search performance of monkeys by training them to discriminate
              the orientation of a briefly-presented, peripheral Landolt-C
              target embedded within an array of distractor stimuli while
              maintaining fixation. We found that target discrimination
              performance declined steeply as the number of distractors
              increased when the target and distractors were of the same color,
              but not when the target was an odd color (color pop-out).
              Performance was also strongly affected by peripheral spatial
              precues presented before target onset, with better performance
              seen when the precue coincided with the target location (valid
              precue) than when it did not (invalid precue). Moreover, the
              effectiveness of valid precues was greatest when the delay
              between precue and target was short (∼80-100 ms), and gradually
              declined with longer delays, consistent with a transient
              component to the cueing effect. Discrimination performance was
              also significantly affected by prior knowledge of the target
              location in the absence of explicit visual precues. These results
              demonstrate that covert visual search performance in macaques is

               results when one assumes that the lapse rate equals zero but
               lapses do occur, but fail to replicate their finding that
               freeing the lapse rate eliminates this bias. Instead, I show
               that significant and systematic bias remains in both threshold
               and slope estimates even when one frees the lapse rate according
               to Wichmann and Hill's suggestion. I explain the mechanisms
               behind the bias and propose an alternative strategy to
               incorporate the lapse rate into psychometric function models,
               which does result in essentially unbiased parameter estimates.",

               representation of a point in the visual world is different
               across eye positions. It was recently reported that human

               ``spatiotopic'' reference frame. We used visuotopic mapping with

  abstract = "How is temporal information processed in human visual cortex?
              Visual input is relayed to V1 through segregated transient and
              sustained channels in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus
              (LGN). However, there is intense debate as to how sustained and
              transient temporal channels contribute to visual processing
              beyond V1. The prevailing view associates transient processing
              predominately with motion-sensitive regions and sustained
              processing with ventral stream regions, while the opposing view
              suggests that both temporal channels contribute to neural
              processing beyond V1. Using fMRI, we measured cortical responses
              to time-varying stimuli and then implemented a two temporal
              channel-encoding model to evaluate the contributions of each
              channel. Different from the general linear model of fMRI that
              predicts responses directly from the stimulus, the encoding
              approach first models neural responses to the stimulus from which
              fMRI responses are derived. This encoding approach not only
              predicts cortical responses to time-varying stimuli from
              milliseconds to seconds but also, reveals differential
              contributions of temporal channels across visual cortex.
              Consistent with the prevailing view, motion-sensitive regions and
              adjacent lateral occipitotemporal regions are dominated by
              transient responses. However, ventral occipitotemporal regions
              are driven by both sustained and transient channels, with
              transient responses exceeding the sustained. These findings
              propose a rethinking of temporal processing in the ventral stream
              and suggest that transient processing may contribute to rapid
              extraction of the content of the visual input. Importantly, our
              encoding approach has vast implications, because it can be
              applied with fMRI to decipher neural computations in millisecond
              resolution in any part of the brain.",

               information. To manage this complexity, visual attention is
               guided to important scene regions in real time 1--7 . What
               factors guide attention within scenes? A leading theoretical
               position suggests that visual salience based on semantically
               uninterpreted image features plays the critical causal role in
               attentional guidance, with knowledge and meaning playing a

               that meaning plays the dominant role in guiding human attention

               maps' that represent the semantic richness of scene regions in a
               format that can be directly compared to image salience. We then
               contrasted the degree to which the spatial distributions of
               meaning and salience predict viewers' overt attention within
               scenes. The results showed that both meaning and salience
               predicted the distribution of attention, but that when the
               relationship between meaning and salience was controlled, only
               meaning accounted for unique variance in attention. This pattern
               of results was apparent from the very earliest time-point in
               scene viewing. We conclude that meaning is the driving force

              successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity,
              however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must
              derive efficient representations of the environment from
              high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past
              experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other
              animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious
              combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory
              processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural

              investigated how such suppression is implemented at the neural
              level. We measured human brain activity in response to natural
              scene photographs that could contain objects from (1) a currently

              patterns in object-selective cortex carried information about
              objects present in the scenes. However, this information strongly
              depended on the task relevance of the objects. As expected,
              information about the target category was significantly increased

              What are the neural mechanisms mediating detection of objects in
              natural scenes? Here, we use human brain imaging to address the
              role of top-down preparatory processes in the detection of
              familiar object categories in real-world environments. Brain
              activity was measured while participants were preparing to detect
              highly variable depictions of people or cars in natural scenes
              that were new to the participants. The preparation to detect
              objects of the target category, in the absence of visual input,
              evoked activity patterns in visual cortex that resembled the
              response to actual exemplars of the target category. Importantly,
              the selectivity of multivoxel preparatory activity patterns in
              object-selective cortex (OSC) predicted target detection
              performance. By contrast, preparatory activity in early visual
              cortex (V1) was negatively related to search performance.
              Additional behavioral results suggested that the dissociation
              between OSC and V1 reflected the use of different search
              strategies, linking OSC preparatory activity to relatively
              abstract search preparation and V1 to more specific imagery-like
              preparation. Finally, whole-brain searchlight analyses revealed
              that, in addition to OSC, response patterns in medial prefrontal
              cortex distinguished the target categories based on the search
              cues alone, suggesting that this region may constitute a top-down
              source of preparatory activity observed in visual cortex. These
              results indicate that in naturalistic situations, when the
              precise visual characteristics of target objects are not known in
              advance, preparatory activity at higher levels of the visual
              hierarchy selectively mediates visual search.",

              important both as tools for scientific data analysis and as
              models of human learning, yet they suffer from a critical
              limitation. Scientists discover qualitatively new forms of
              structure in observed data: For instance, Linnaeus recognized the
              hierarchical organization of biological species, and Mendeleev
              recognized the periodic structure of the chemical elements.
              Analogous insights play a pivotal role in cognitive development:
              Children discover that object category labels can be organized
              into hierarchies, friendship networks are organized into cliques,
              and comparative relations (e.g., ``bigger than'' or ``better
              than'') respect a transitive order. Standard algorithms, however,
              can only learn structures of a single form that must be specified
              in advance: For instance, algorithms for hierarchical clustering
              create tree structures, whereas algorithms for
              dimensionality-reduction create low-dimensional spaces. Here, we
              present a computational model that learns structures of many
              different forms and that discovers which form is best for a given
              dataset. The model makes probabilistic inferences over a space of
              graph grammars representing trees, linear orders,
              multidimensional spaces, rings, dominance hierarchies, cliques,
              and other forms and successfully discovers the underlying

               clients and particularly for clients from another culture.
               Culture shapes the values, beliefs, norms, and practices of

               affects the assessment and management of pain. Conclusions:
               Seven strategies can assist in culturally appropriate assessment
               and management of pain: (1) utilize assessment tools to assist
               in measuring pain, (2) appreciate variations in affective
               response to pain, (3) be sensitive to variations in
               communication styles, (4) recognize that communication of pain
               may not be acceptable within a culture, (5) appreciate that the
               meaning of pain varies between cultures, (6) utilize knowledge

              the benefits of flossing or the costs of not flossing. White

              qualitatively different effects on firing rate, depending on
              whether a stimulus appears alone or accompanied by distracters.
              Studies of contrast gain control in anesthetized mammals have

              Spatial and feature attention have similar effects on individual

              however, spatial attention can comodulate local neuronal

              cortical activity in several cortical visual areas including
              primary visual cortex (V1) and the MT complex (MT+) as subjects
              performed a variety of threshold-level visual psychophysical
              tasks. Performing speed, direction, and contrast discrimination
              tasks produced strong modulations of cortical activity. For
              example, one experiment tested for selective modulations of MT+
              activity as subjects alternated between performing contrast and
              speed discrimination tasks. MT+ responses modulated in phase with
              the periods of time during which subjects performed the speed

              speed discrimination than during contrast discrimination.
              Task-related modulations were consistent across repeated

              state of a subject can exert selective and reliable modulations
              of cortical activity in early visual cortex, even in V1; 2) that

              (fMRI) to test key predictions of the object-based theory, which
              proposes that pre-attentive mechanisms segment the visual array
              into discrete objects, groups, or surfaces, which serve as
              targets for visual attention. Subjects viewed stimuli consisting
              of a face transparently superimposed on a house, with one moving
              and the other stationary. In different conditions, subjects
              attended to the face, the house or the motion. The magnetic
              resonance signal from each subject's fusiform face area,
              parahippocampal place area and area MT/MST provided a measure of
              the processing of faces, houses and visual motion, respectively.
              Although all three attributes occupied the same location,
              attending to one attribute of an object (such as the motion of a
              moving face) enhanced the neural representation not only of that
              attribute but also of the other attribute of the same object (for
              example, the face), compared with attributes of the other object
              (for example, the house). These results cannot be explained by
              models in which attention selects locations or features, and

              (VTC), and ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (VLFPC) constitute
              the extended ``what'' pathway, which is considered instrumental
              for visual category processing. However, it is unknown (1)
              whether distributed responses across LOTC, VTC, and VLPFC

              knowledge, we scanned 12 participants using fMRI to test the
              effect of category and task on distributed responses across LOTC,
              VTC, and VLPFC. Results reveal that task and category modulate
              responses in both high-level visual regions, as well as

              types of representations across the brain. Distributed responses
              in high-level visual regions are more strongly driven by category
              than task, and exhibit task-independent category representations.
              In contrast, distributed responses in prefrontal cortex are more
              strongly driven by task than category, and contain task-dependent
              category representations. Together, these findings of
              differential representations across the brain support a new idea

  author   = "Kaiser, Daniel and Oosterhof, Nikolaas N and Peelen, Marius V",
  abstract = "The human visual system can only represent a small subset of the
              many objects present in cluttered scenes at any given time, such
              that objects compete for representation. Despite these processing
              limitations, the detection of object categories in cluttered
              natural scenes is remarkably rapid. How does the brain
              efficiently select goal-relevant objects from cluttered scenes?
              In the present study, we used multivariate decoding of
              magneto-encephalography (MEG) data to track the neural
              representation of within-scene objects as a function of top-down
              attentional set. Participants detected categorical targets (cars
              or people) in natural scenes. The presence of these categories
              within a scene was decoded from MEG sensor patterns by training
              linear classifiers on differentiating cars and people in
              isolation and testing these classifiers on scenes containing one
              of the two categories. The presence of a specific category in a
              scene could be reliably decoded from MEG response patterns as
              early as 160 ms, despite substantial scene clutter and variation
              in the visual appearance of each category. Strikingly, we find
              that these early categorical representations fully depend on the
              match between visual input and top-down attentional set: only
              objects that matched the current attentional set were processed
              to the category level within the first 200 ms after scene onset.
              A sensor-space searchlight analysis revealed that this early
              attention bias was localized to lateral occipitotemporal cortex,
              reflecting top-down modulation of visual processing. These
              results show that attention quickly resolves competition between
              objects in cluttered natural scenes, allowing for the rapid
              neural representation of goal-relevant objects. SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT: Efficient attentional selection is crucial in many
              everyday situations. For example, when driving a car, we need to
              quickly detect obstacles, such as pedestrians crossing the
              street, while ignoring irrelevant objects. How can humans
              efficiently perform such tasks, given the multitude of objects
              contained in real-world scenes? Here we used multivariate
              decoding of magnetoencephalogaphy data to characterize the neural
              underpinnings of attentional selection in natural scenes with
              high temporal precision. We show that brain activity quickly
              tracks the presence of objects in scenes, but crucially only for
              those objects that were immediately relevant for the participant.
              These results provide evidence for fast and efficient attentional
              selection that mediates the rapid detection of goal-relevant
              objects in real-world environments.",

               Space-based theories propose a limit on the spatial area from
               which information can be taken up. To distinguish these views,
               the present experiments used small (less than 1 degree), brief,

              processing, yet observers can also ignore such stimuli when their
              goals require directing attention elsewhere. A powerful
              determinant of visual salience is local feature contrast: if a
              local region differs from its immediate surround along one or
              more feature dimensions, it will appear more salient. We used
              high-resolution functional MRI (fMRI) at 7T to characterize the

              specific, goal-driven enhancement of stimuli, salient items
              outside of the current focus of attention must also be
              prioritized. We used 7T fMRI to compare salience and spatial

              report additive effects of attention and bottom-up salience in

              representation. Within cortical visual areas V1, V2, and V3,
              algebraic transformations can relate position in the visual field
              to the retinotopic representation on the flattened cortical
              sheet. A limit to the practical application of this
              structure-function model is that the cortex, while topologically
              a two-dimensional surface, is curved. Flattening of the curved
              surface to a plane unavoidably introduces local geometric
              distortions that are not accounted for in idealized models. Here,
              we show that this limitation is overcome by correcting the
              geometric distortion induced by cortical flattening. We use a
              mass-spring-damper simulation to create a registration between
              functional MRI retinotopic mapping data of visual areas V1, V2,
              and V3 and an algebraic model of retinotopy. This registration is
              then applied to the flattened cortical surface anatomy to create
              an anatomical template that is linked to the algebraic
              retinotopic model. This registered cortical template can be used
              to accurately predict the location and retinotopic organization
              of these early visual areas from cortical anatomy alone.
              Moreover, we show that prediction accuracy remains when

              information processing in nearly all domains of cognition, we
              sought to reconcile these competing accounts by testing the
              hypothesis that extensive behavioral training alters the neural
              mechanisms that support selective attention. We tested this
              hypothesis using electroencephalography (EEG) to measure
              stimulus-evoked visual responses from human subjects while they
              performed a selective spatial attention task over the course of
              ~1 month. Early in training, spatial attention led to an increase
              in the gain of stimulus-evoked visual responses. Gain was
              apparent within ~100 ms of stimulus onset, and a quantitative
              model based on signal detection theory (SDT) successfully linked
              the magnitude of this gain modulation to attention-related
              improvements in behavior. However, after extensive training, this
              early attentional gain was eliminated even though there were
              still substantial attention-related improvements in behavior.
              Accordingly, the SDT-based model required noise reduction to
              account for the link between the stimulus-evoked visual responses
              and attentional modulations of behavior. These findings suggest
              that training can lead to fundamental changes in the way

               They derived new predictions of the models for a common set of
               behavioral tests that were compared with the data in the
               literature and a new experiment. The comparison between the
               model predictions and the empirical data resulted in very strong
               constraints on the observer models. The perceptual template
               model provided the best account of all the empirical data in the
               visual domain. The choice of the observer model has significant
               implications for the interpretation of data from other external
               noise paradigms, as well as studies using external noise to
               assay changes of perceptual limitations associated with observer
               states. The empirical and theoretical development suggests
               possible parallel developments in other sensory modalities and

              dimensions: contrast, spatial position, orientation, spatial
              frequency, temporal frequency, and direction of motion. First,
              the responses of single neurons were measured along each stimulus
              dimension, using analysis intervals comparable to a normal
              fixation interval (200 ms). Second, the measured responses of
              each neuron were fitted with simple descriptive functions,
              containing a few free parameters, for each stimulus dimension.
              These functions were found to account for approximately 90\% of
              the variance in the measured response means and response standard
              deviations. (A detailed analysis of the relationship between the
              mean and the variance showed that the variance is proportional to
              the mean.) Third, the parameters of the best-fitting descriptive
              functions were utilized in conjunction with Bayesian (optimal)
              decision theory to determine the detection, discrimination, and
              identification performance for each neuron, along each stimulus
              dimension. For some of the cells in monkey, discrimination
              performance was comparable to behavioral performance; for most of
              the cells in cat, discrimination performance was better than
              behavioral performance. The behavioral contrast and
              spatial-frequency discrimination functions were similar in shape
              to the envelope of the most sensitive cells; they were also
              similar to the discrimination functions obtained by optimal
              pooling of the entire population of cells. The statistics which
              summarize the parameters of the descriptive functions were used
              to estimate the response of the visual cortex as a whole to a
              complex natural image. The analysis suggests that individual

              specialization of function in the normal human visual cortex. A
              novel technique, statistical parametric mapping, was used to
              detect foci of significant change in cerebral blood flow within
              the prestriate cortex, in order to localize those parts involved
              in the perception of color and visual motion. For color, we
              stimulated the subjects with a multicolored abstract display
              containing no recognizable objects (Land color Mondrian) and
              contrasted the resulting blood flow maps with those obtained when
              subjects viewed an identical display consisting of equiluminous
              shades of gray. The comparison identified a unique area (area V4)
              located in the lingual and fusiform gyri of the prestriate
              cortex. For motion, blood flow maps when subjects viewed moving
              or stationary black and white random-square patterns were
              contrasted. The comparison identified a unique area located in
              the region of the temporo-parieto-occipital junction (area V5).
              We thus provide direct evidence to show that, just as in the

               found that area MT responded selectively to moving (compared to
               stationary) stimuli. The location of human MT in the present
               fMRI results is consistent with that of MT in earlier PET and
               anatomical studies. In addition we found that area MT has a much
               higher contrast sensitivity than that in several other areas,
               including primary visual cortex (V1). Functional MRI
               half-amplitudes in V1 and MT occurred at approximately 15\% and
               1\% luminance contrast, respectively. High sensitivity to
               contrast and motion in MT have been closely associated with
               magnocellular stream specialization in nonhuman primates. Human
               psychophysics indicates that visual motion appears to diminish

               Electrophysiological results from macaque MT suggest that the

               cells at equiluminance. We show here that fMRI activity in human

              inefficiencies in perceptual processes is the method of
              equivalent internal noise--the amount of random internal noise
              necessary to produce the degree of inefficiency exhibited by the
              perceptual system in processing [J. Opt. Soc. Am. 46, 634
              (1956)]. One normally estimates the amount of equivalent internal
              noise by systematically increasing the amount of external noise
              added to the signal stimulus and observing how threshold--signal
              stimulus energy required for an observer to maintain a given
              performance level--depends on the amount of external noise. In a
              variety of perceptual tasks, a simple noisy linear amplifier
              model [D. Pelli, Ph.D. dissertation (University of Cambridge,
              Cambridge, UK 1981)] has been utilized to estimate the equivalent
              internal noise Ninternal by fitting of the relation between
              threshold contrast c tau and external noise N(ext) at a single
              (d') performance level: c tau 2 =(d'/beta)2(N(ext)2 +
              Ninternal2). This model makes a strong prediction: Independent of
              observer and external noise contrast, the ratio between two
              thresholds at each external noise level is equal to the ratio of
              the two corresponding d' values. To our knowledge, this potential
              test for the internal consistency of the model had never been
              examined previously. In this study we estimated threshold ratios
              between multiple performance levels at various external noise
              contrasts in two different experiments: Gabor orientation
              identification, and Gabor detection. We found that, in both
              identification and detection, the observed threshold ratios
              between different performance levels departed substantially from
              the d' ratio predicted by the simple noisy linear amplifier
              model. An elaborated perceptual template model [Vision Res. 38,
              1183 (1998)] with nonlinear transducer functions and
              multiplicative noise in addition to the additive noise in the

              description of the data and suggests a reinterpretation of
              earlier results that relied on the simple noisy linear amplifier

              activity-level correlations between pairs of neurons. How
              attention changes neuronal activity correlations is unknown.
              Using multielectrodes in monkey visual cortex, we measured
              spike-count correlations when single or multiple stimuli were
              presented and when stimuli were attended or unattended. When
              stimuli were unattended, adding a suppressive, nonpreferred
              stimulus beside a preferred stimulus increased spike-count
              correlations between pairs of similarly tuned neurons but
              decreased spike-count correlations between pairs of oppositely
              tuned neurons. A stochastic normalization model containing
              populations of oppositely tuned, mutually suppressive neurons
              explains these changes and also explains why attention decreased
              or increased correlations: as an indirect consequence of
              attention-related changes in the inputs to normalization
              mechanisms. Our findings link normalization mechanisms to
              correlated neuronal activity and attention, showing that
              normalization mechanisms shape response correlations and that
              these correlations change when attention biases normalization

               analytical predictions. For nonbursting cells firing at
               sustained rates up to 300 Hz, we evaluated two indices of firing
               variability: the ratio of the variance to the mean for the
               number of action potentials evoked by a constant stimulus, and
               the rate-normalized coefficient of variation (Cv) of the

               MT neurons was nearly consistent with a completely random
               process (e.g., Cv approximately 1). We tried to model this high
               variability by small, independent, and random EPSPs converging
               onto a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron (Knight, 1972). Both this
               and related models predicted very low firing variability (Cv <

               constants. We also simulated a biophysically very detailed

               currents (INa and very strong IDR) were placed on distal
               dendrites. Now the simulated neuron acted more as a
               millisecond-resolution detector of dendritic spike coincidences

              identification, in particular the use of Volterra series. The
              approach employed enables one to estimate Volterra kernels that
              describe the relationship between stimulus presentation and the
              hemodynamic responses that ensue. Volterra series are essentially
              high-order extensions of linear convolution or ``smoothing.''
              These kernels, therefore, represent a nonlinear characterization
              of the hemodynamic response function that can model the responses
              to stimuli in different contexts (in this work, different rates
              of word presentation) and interactions among stimuli. The
              nonlinear components of the responses were shown to be
              statistically significant, and the kernel estimates were
              validated using an independent event-related fMRI experiment. One
              important manifestation of these nonlinear effects is a
              modulation of stimulus-specific responses by preceding stimuli
              that are proximate in time. This means that responses at
              high-stimulus presentation rates saturate and, in some instances,

               Salzman et al., 1990; Britten et al., 1992; Britten et al.,
               1996). We have now used numerical simulations to try to
               understand how neural signals in area MT support psychophysical
               decisions. We developed a model that pools neuronal responses
               drawn from our physiological data set and compares average
               responses in different pools to produce psychophysical
               decisions. The structure of the model allows us to assess the
               relationship between ``neuronal'' input signals and simulated
               psychophysical performance using the same methods we have
               applied to real experimental data. We sought to reconcile three
               experimental observations: psychophysical performance (threshold
               sensitivity to motion stimuli embedded in noise), a
               trial-by-trial covariation between the neural response and the
               monkey's choices, and a modest correlation between pairs of MT
               neurons in their variable responses to identical visual stimuli.
               Our results can be most accurately simulated if psychophysical
               decisions are based on pools of at least 100 weakly correlated
               sensory neurons. The neurons composing the pools must include a
               broader range of sensitivities than we encountered in our MT
               recordings, presumably because of the inclusion of neurons whose
               optimal stimulus is different from the one being discriminated.
               Central sources of noise degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of
               the pooled signal, but this degradation is relatively small
               compared with the noise typically carried by single cortical
               neurons. This suggests that our monkeys base near-threshold
               psychophysical judgments on signals carried by populations of
               weakly interacting neurons; these populations include many
               neurons that are not tuned optimally for the particular stimuli

              study the operational organization of the human brain, but the
              exact relationship between the measured fMRI signal and the
              underlying neural activity is unclear. Here we present
              simultaneous intracortical recordings of neural signals and fMRI
              responses. We compared local field potentials (LFPs), single- and
              multi-unit spiking activity with highly spatio-temporally
              resolved blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI responses from
              the visual cortex of monkeys. The largest magnitude changes were
              observed in LFPs, which at recording sites characterized by
              transient responses were the only signal that significantly
              correlated with the haemodynamic response. Linear systems
              analysis on a trial-by-trial basis showed that the impulse
              response of the neurovascular system is both animal- and
              site-specific, and that LFPs yield a better estimate of BOLD
              responses than the multi-unit responses. These findings suggest
              that the BOLD contrast mechanism reflects the input and
              intracortical processing of a given area rather than its spiking
              output.",

              of the superior temporal sulcus to receive a projection from

              visual stimulation is reported. Ten monkeys were studied.2. A
              clear but relatively crude topographic representation of the
              visual field was found. There was a large variation in the size
              of the receptive fields of individual cells, even in a single
              penetration. Some cells, with the central parts of their
              receptive fields located from between 1 and 5 degrees from the
              centre of gaze had receptive fields averaging about 10 degrees x
              10 degrees or even larger. Other cells with central receptive
              fields had much smaller field sizes.3. Two main types of neurones
              were encountered, with subdivisions within each type. The first
              type responded to movement irrespective of form. These could be
              subdivided into neurones which responded to movement in any
              direction within the receptive field and neurones which responded
              to movement in one direction only (directionally selective
              neurones). Another type of cell was responsive to both contour
              and movement, much like the complex and lower order hypercomplex
              cells. Almost all such neurones were directionally selective.4.
              In oblique penetrations through this cortical region, there
              tended frequently to be an orderly shift in preferred directions
              of motion, thus suggesting the possibility of a columnar

              and using the same visual display. In addition, the

               gender, and language; or Ayumu, the young male chimpanzee at

               shame. Based on research involving crows, dolphins, parrots,
               sheep, wasps, bats, whales, and of course chimpanzees and
               bonobos, Frans de Waal explores both the scope and the depth of

               science has stood traditional behaviorism on its head by
               revealing how smart animals really are, and how we've
               underestimated their abilities for too long. People often assume
               a cognitive ladder, from lower to higher forms, with our own

              updates representations of visual space in anticipation of a

              brain structures (Duhamel et al., 1992; Walker et al., 1995;

               positions surrounding the CRF, and the location of the bar
               stimulus was varied across five positions spanning the CRF. 2.
               Response strength depended on two aspects of the spatial
               relationship between the stimulus driving the cell (the bar) and
               the position of attention (the target ring). First, for 49\% of
               the cells studied, responses were greater for bar stimuli near
               the attended ring; i.e., the receptive field profile shifted
               toward the attentional focus. Second, for 84\% of the cells, the
               overall response level depended on the direction in which

               shifts expanded the representation of the attended category and
               of semantically related, but unattended, categories, and
               compressed the representation of categories that were

              information from our visual environment. We have recently
              demonstrated that attention attracts receptive fields across the
              visual hierarchy (Klein, Harvey, \& Dumoulin, 2014). We captured
              this receptive field attraction using an attention field model.
              Here, we apply this model to human perception: We predict that

              position, which depends on the size of the underlying receptive
              fields. We instructed participants to compare the relative

              attention using exogenous cueing. We varied the eccentric
              position and spatial frequency of the Gabor stimuli to vary
              underlying receptive field size. The positional biases as a

              differently across the visual hierarchy, we speculate that they

  author   = "Vo, Vy A and Sprague, Thomas C and Serences, John T",
  abstract = "Selective visual attention enables organisms to enhance the
              representation of behaviorally relevant stimuli by altering the
              encoding properties of single receptive fields (RFs). Yet we know
              little about how the attentional modulations of single RFs
              contribute to the encoding of an entire visual scene. Addressing
              this issue requires (1) measuring a group of RFs that tile a
              continuous portion of visual space, (2) constructing a
              population-level measurement of spatial representations based on
              these RFs, and (3) linking how different types of RF attentional
              modulations change the population-level representation. To
              accomplish these aims, we used fMRI to characterize the responses
              of thousands of voxels in retinotopically organized human cortex.
              First, we found that the response modulations of voxel RFs (vRFs)
              depend on the spatial relationship between the RF center and the
              visual location of the attended target. Second, we used two
              analyses to assess the spatial encoding quality of a population
              of voxels. We found that attention increased fine spatial
              discriminability and representational fidelity near the attended
              target. Third, we linked these findings by manipulating the
              observed vRF attentional modulations and recomputing our measures
              of the fidelity of population codes. Surprisingly, we discovered
              that attentional enhancements of population-level representations
              largely depend on position shifts of vRFs, rather than changes in
              size or gain. Our data suggest that position shifts of single RFs
              are a principal mechanism by which attention enhances
              population-level representations in visual cortex.SIGNIFICANCE
              STATEMENT Although changes in the gain and size of RFs have
              dominated our view of how attention modulates visual information
              codes, such hypotheses have largely relied on the extrapolation
              of single-cell responses to population responses. Here we use
              fMRI to relate changes in single voxel receptive fields (vRFs) to
              changes in population-level representations. We find that vRF
              position shifts contribute more to population-level enhancements
              of visual information than changes in vRF size or gain. This
              finding suggests that position shifts are a principal mechanism
              by which spatial attention enhances population codes for relevant
              visual information. This poses challenges for labeled line
              theories of information processing, suggesting that downstream
              regions likely rely on distributed inputs rather than single
              neuron-to-neuron mappings.",

              MRI (fMRI) (7T) while subjects performed an attention-demanding
              task at different locations. We show that spatial attention

              scales with study size and with the heterogeneity of multi-site
              data. Here, we describe a tool for the automated assessment of
              T1-weighted MR images of the brain - MRIQC. MRIQC calculates a
              set of quality measures from each image and uses them as features

              designed to ensure generalization to new samples acquired in
              different centers and using different scanning parameters from
              our training dataset. To achieve that goal, the classifier was
              trained on the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) dataset
              (N=1102), acquired at 17 locations with heterogeneous scanning

              Tolhurst, 2003; Chirimuuta \& Tolhurst, 2005a). In these
              simulations, the contrast of a visual stimulus was encoded by a
              model spiking neuron or a set of such neurons. The mean spike
              count of each neuron was given by a sigmoidal function of
              contrast, the Naka-Rushton function. The actual number of spikes
              generated on each trial was determined by a doubly stochastic
              Poisson process. The spike counts were decoded using a Bayesian
              decoder to give an estimate of the stimulus contrast. Tolhurst
              and colleagues used the estimated contrast values to assess the
              model's performance in a number of ways, and they uncovered
              several relationships between properties of the neurons and
              characteristics of performance. Although this work made a
              substantial contribution to our understanding of the links
              between physiology and perceptual performance, the Monte Carlo
              simulations provided little insight into why the obtained

              these problems by deriving equations that predict the model's

              precision using Fisher information. We also analyzed the model's

              unknown theoretical connection between the Naka-Rushton
              contrast-response function and the Weibull psychometric function.
              Our equations give many insights into the theoretical

              contrast-response functions of V1 neurons do have this sigmoidal
              shape, but individual neurons do not generally have a dynamic
              range wide enough to account for the dipper effect. This paper
              presents a Bayesian model of neurons in monkey V1, whose

  abstract = "Although perceptual decision making activates a network of brain
              areas involved in sensory, integrative, and motor functions,
              circuit activity can clearly be modulated by factors beyond the
              stimulus. Of particular interest is to understand how the network
              is modulated by top-down factors such as attention. Here, we
              demonstrate in a motion coherence task that selective attention
              produces marked changes in the blood oxygen level-dependent
              (BOLD) response in a subset of regions within a human perceptual
              decision-making circuit. Specifically, when motion is attended,
              the BOLD response decreases with increasing motion coherence in
              many regions, including the motion-sensitive area MT+, the
              intraparietal sulcus, and the inferior frontal sulcus. However,
              when motion is ignored, the negative parametric response in a
              subset of this circuit becomes positive. Through both modeling
              and connectivity analyses, we demonstrate that this inversion
              both reflects a top-down influence and segregates attentional
              from accumulation regions, thereby permitting us to further
              delineate the contributions of different regions to the

  title     = "Parietal and prefrontal: categorical differences?",

  abstract  = "Despite the fact that, to perform the task, the monkey must have
               some working memory of the direction of the dots, neurons in LIP
               showed near chance-level encoding of motion direction during the
               delay period. This lack of delay-period selectivity is not a
               result of information about motion direction not entering LIP;
               during stimulus presentation, the motion direction was clearly
               represented. The neurons just seem to forget the direction when
               it most matters. Notably, the nearby medial superior temporal
               area, MST, which also receives direction-selective information
               from the medial temporal motion selective area MT, has by
               contrast been shown to carry working memory representa-tions of
               motion direction 5 . Although clearly a provocative finding,
               task and training are intertwined in the experi-ments as
               outlined above, making it unclear which accounts for the
               difference in LIP activ-ity. Parietal working memory activity
               might arise only after sufficient training. Given that the
               delayed match-to-sample task was trained first, it is possible
               that lack of working memory representation comes not from a
               difference in task, but from a lack of training. The authors
               have provided a detailed view into their train-ing structure,
               which helps to allay this concern. In particular, the monkeys
               were extensively trained on the delayed match-to-sample task
               (hundreds of daily sessions and hundreds of thousands of
               trials), and their performance had plateaued. Although sorting
               out training and task by design awaits future replication
               studies, clearly the monkeys had substantial experience with the
               delayed match-to-sample task, therefore suggesting that task,
               and not training, accounts for the difference. Potential
               alternative explanations aside, pause for a second to consider
               the extensive training regime. Why does it take monkeys so long
               to learn so little? It seems intuitive that a But how exactly
               does one get a monkey to make categorical decisions repeatedly
               and in a controlled way so that the neural representa-tions can
               be systematically studied? Continuing in the tradition of their
               labora-tory 4 , Sarma et al. 3 have developed formidable skills
               in training monkeys to do just this. In the current work, they
               shaped behavior incrementally, starting with a sequence of
               sim-pler tasks before making the leap into categori-cal
               decisions. The authors trained monkeys to perform a delayed
               match-to-sample task in which the monkeys were required to
               remem-ber the direction of a patch of briefly presented moving
               dots and release a lever only if the direction of a second dot
               patch, presented after a short delay, exactly matched the
               remembered direction. After monkeys reached criterion
               performance, they were trained on the full categorization task,
               which was identical except for one crucial difference. In the
               categorization task, the monkeys were trained to release the
               lever not when the two directions were iden-tical but when they
               were in the same experi-menter chosen category (that is, moved
               in the same direction relative to an arbitrary category
               boundary). A series of studies has provided abundant support
               that, after such categoriza-tion training, neurons in LIP and
               prefrontal cortex show a beautifully simple and stable
               representation of the category, preferring stimuli in either one
               category or the other 4 . The new insight concerning working
               mem-ory came from a relatively simple proposition that led to an
               unexpected result: record the activity of neurons before as well
               as after the training of the categorization task. Given that,
               after training, LIP neurons encode category during the delay
               period, might one expect that a working memory representation
               encoding direction would be present for the delayed
               match-to-sample task? Oddly, the answer is no. and update our

              is an important step on the road to a thorough understanding of
              the cognitive and cerebral correlates of conscious perception. In
              this article, we present a critical review of research on
              subliminal perception during masking and other related
              experimental conditions. Although initially controversial, the
              possibility that a broad variety of processes can be activated by
              a non-reportable stimulus is now well established. Behavioural
              findings of subliminal priming indicate that a masked word or
              digit can have an influence on perceptual, lexical and semantic
              levels, while neuroimaging directly visualizes the brain
              activation that it evokes in several cortical areas. This
              activation is often attenuated under subliminal presentation
              conditions compared to consciously reportable conditions, but
              there are sufficiently many exceptions, in paradigms such as the
              attentional blink, to indicate that high activation, per se, is
              not a sufficient condition for conscious access to occur. We
              conclude by arguing that for a stimulus to reach consciousness,
              two factors are jointly needed: (i) the input stimulus must have
              enough strength (which can be prevented by masking) and (ii) it
              must receive top-down attention (which can be prevented by
              drawing attention to another stimulus or task). This view leads
              to a distinction between two types of non-conscious processes,
              which we call subliminal and preconscious. According to us,
              maintaining this distinction is essential in order to make sense

              distributed attention. Focal attention yielded robust
              improvements in behavioral performance accompanied by increases

               which stimulus-evoked activity in visual cortex depends on
               attention and awareness. Some influential theories of
               consciousness maintain that the allocation of attention is
               restricted to conscious representations [1, 2]. However, in the
               load theory of attention [3], competition between task-relevant
               and task-irrelevant stimuli for limited-capacity attention does
               not depend on conscious perception of the irrelevant stimuli.
               The critical test is whether the level of attentional load in a
               relevant task would determine unconscious neural processing of
               invisible stimuli. Human participants were scanned with
               high-field fMRI while they performed a foveal task of low or
               high attentional load. Irrelevant, invisible monocular stimuli
               were simultaneously presented peripherally and were continuously
               suppressed by a flashing mask in the other eye [4]. Attentional
               load in the foveal task strongly modulated retinotopic activity
               evoked in primary visual cortex (V1) by the invisible stimuli.
               Contrary to traditional views [1, 2, 5, 6], we found that
               availability of attentional capacity determines neural
               representations related to unconscious processing of

              arise in the absence of attention. This claim is largely based on
              the notion that natural scene (or ``gist'') perception occurs
              without attention. This article presents evidence against this
              idea. We show that when observers perform a variety of demanding,
              sustained-attention tasks, inattentional blindness occurs for
              natural scenes. In addition, scene perception is impaired under
              dual-task conditions, but only when the primary task is
              sufficiently demanding. This finding suggests that previous

              perception without attention failed to fully engage attention and

              considerable interindividual differences, but there is general

              frequencies, and contrasts. Second, we show that LTP occludes the

              occludes TBS-induced LTP of the VEP evoked by the experienced

              active kinase known to maintain NMDA receptor-dependent LTP and

              LTP. SRP therefore provides a simple assay to assess the
              integrity of LTP in the intact nervous system. Moreover, the

               characterize the dynamics of cortical responses during a
               disparity-discrimination task. After the onset of a
               disparity-defined target, decision-related activity was found
               within an extended cortical network that included several
               occipital regions of interest (ROIs): V4, V3A, hMT+ and the
               Lateral Occipital Complex (LOC). By using a response-locked
               analysis, we were able to determine the timing relationships in
               this network of ROIs relative to the subject's behavioral
               response. Choice-related activity appeared first in the V4 ROI
               almost 200. ms before the button press and then subsequently in
               the V3A ROI. Modeling of the responses in the V4 ROI suggests
               that this area provides an early contribution to disparity
               discrimination. Choice-related responses were also found after
               the button-press in ROIs V4, V3A, LOC and hMT+. Outside the
               visual cortex, choice-related activity was found in the frontal
               and temporal poles before the button-press. By combining the

              specifically associated with conscious perception, and which

              neuroimaging studies have contrasted conscious and non-conscious

  abstract = "In this fMRI study, we investigated the convergence of underlying
              neural networks in thinking about a scenario involving one's own
              intentional action and its consequences and setting up and
              holding in mind an intention to act. A factorial design was
              employed comprising two factors: i. Causality (intentional or
              physical events) and ii. Prospective Memory (present or absent).
              In each condition, subjects answered questions about various
              hypothetical scenarios, which related either to the link between
              the subject's own intentions and consequential actions
              (Intentional Causality) or to the link between a natural,
              physical event and its consequences (Physical Causality). A
              prospective memory task was embedded in half the blocks. In this
              task, subjects were required to keep in mind an intention (to
              press a key on seeing a red stimulus background) whilst carrying
              out the ongoing Causality task. Answering questions about
              intentional causality versus physical causality activated a
              network of regions that have traditionally been associated with
              Theory of Mind, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC),
              the superior temporal sulcus and the temporal poles bilaterally.
              In addition, the precuneus bordering with posterior cingulate
              cortex, an area involved in self-awareness and self-related
              processing, was activated more when thinking about intentional
              causality. In the prospective memory task, activations were found
              in the right parietal cortex, frontopolar cortex (BA 10) and
              precuneus. Different subregions within the precuneus/posterior
              cingulate cortex were activated in both main effects of
              intentional causality and prospective memory. Therefore, the
              precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex subserves separately
              thinking about one's own intentions and consequent actions and
              bearing in mind an intention to make an action. Previous studies
              have shown that prospective memory, requiring the formation of an
              intention and the execution of a corresponding action, is
              associated with decreased activation in the dorsal mPFC, close to
              the region activated in Theory of Mind tasks. Here, we found that
              holding in mind an intention to act and at the same time thinking
              about an intentional action led to reduced activity in a dorsal
              section of the mPFC. This was a different region from a more
              anterior, inferior dorsal mPFC region that responded to
              intentional causality. This suggests that different regions of
              mPFC play different roles in thinking about intentions. ?? 2005

  abstract  = "Willed actions are characterized by the subjective experience of
               'conscious intention'. During the last decade the neural bases
               of this experience have been widely investigated. Previous
               findings have suggested that conscious intention emerges in the
               mesial precentral area (MPA) including the supplementary and
               pre-supplementary motor area. However, this assumption was later
               challenged by evidence indicating a key contribution of the
               inferior parietal lobule (IPL) in this process. In this review
               we show that this second hypothesis is the most plausible. We
               provide behavioral, clinical and electrophysiological evidence
               that IPL, rather than MPA, mediates the early subjective
               experience of 'wanting to move'. We argue that MPA generates a
               feeling of 'motor urge', near movement onset, when the
               inhibitory control exerted on the low-level motor areas is
               released. We propose that goal directed actions trigger two
               forms of motor intention: the first, 'wanting to move' intention
               is under the control of the inferior parietal regions and
               specifies a general goal to be reached before movement planning;
               the second, the 'urge to move' intention, is controlled by
               mesial precentral areas and signals the time when the planned
               movement is about to start. The time locked activation of these
               two forms of intention is at the basis of movement control.",

              demonstrate a behavioral and neural dissociation of these 2 types
              of conflict. During functional magnetic resonance imaging
              scanning, participants performed bimanual reaching movements with
              symmetric (congruent) or orthogonal (incongruent) trajectories.
              The required movements were indicated either spatially, by
              illuminating the targets, or symbolically, using centrally
              presented letters. The processing of symbolic cues led to
              increased activation in a left hemisphere network including the
              intraparietal sulcus, premotor cortex, and inferior frontal
              gyrus. Reaction time cost for incongruent movements was
              substantially larger for symbolic than for spatial cues,
              indicating that the cost was primarily associated with the
              selection and assignment of movement goals, demands that are
              minimized when goals are directly specified by spatial cues. This
              goal-selection conflict increased activity in the

              non-invasive tool to elicit neuromodulation by delivering current
              through electrodes placed on the scalp. The present clinical
              paradigm uses two relatively large electrodes to inject current
              through the head resulting in electric fields that are broadly
              distributed over large regions of the brain. In this paper, we
              present a method that uses multiple small electrodes (i.e. 1.2 cm
              diameter) and systematically optimize the applied currents to
              achieve effective and targeted stimulation while ensuring safety
              of stimulation. We found a fundamental trade-off between
              achievable intensity (at the target) and focality, and algorithms
              to optimize both measures are presented. When compared with large
              pad-electrodes (approximated here by a set of small electrodes
              covering 25 cm(2)), the proposed approach achieves electric
              fields which exhibit simultaneously greater focality (80\%
              improvement) and higher target intensity (98\% improvement) at
              cortical targets using the same total current applied. These
              improvements illustrate the previously unrecognized and
              non-trivial dependence of the optimal electrode configuration on
              the desired electric field orientation and the maximum total
              current (due to safety). Similarly, by exploiting idiosyncratic
              details of brain anatomy, the optimization approach significantly
              improves upon prior un-optimized approaches using small
              electrodes. The analysis also reveals the optimal use of
              conventional bipolar montages: maximally intense tangential
              fields are attained with the two electrodes placed at a
              considerable distance from the target along the direction of the
              desired field; when radial fields are desired, the
              maximum-intensity configuration consists of an electrode placed
              directly over the target with a distant return electrode. To
              summarize, if a target location and stimulation orientation can
              be defined by the clinician, then the proposed technique is
              superior in terms of both focality and intensity as compared to
              previous solutions and is thus expected to translate into

              Here, we examined the roles of ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
              (VLPFC) and posterior middle temporal gyrus (postMTG) in rule
              use. We tested two hypotheses: first, that knowledge about
              actions associated with abstract visual symbols is stored in
              postMTG, and second, that VLPFC is involved in the controlled
              retrieval of rule meanings. Subjects viewed a series of road
              signs during event-related fMRI data collection. Three types of
              signs were intermixed: highly familiar signs, novel signs whose
              meaning was explained to subjects prior to scanning, and novel
              signs whose meaning was not explained. Subjects were asked to
              think about the meaning of each sign as it was presented during
              scanning and then to give its meaning in a post-scan test. Left
              postMTG was more active when subjects viewed signs whose meaning
              they knew than signs whose meaning they did not know, consistent
              with a role in storing rule meanings. This region was not
              modulated by experience, in that it was equally engaged by newly
              trained and well-learned signs. In contrast, right VLPFC was more
              active for newly trained signs than for either well-learned or
              incorrect ones, consistent with a role in controlled retrieval.
              Left VLPFC was reliably engaged while subjects attempted to
              interpret the signs but did not differ according to knowledge or
              experience. These data implicate postMTG in rule storage and
              VLPFC in rule retrieval. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights

              the ability to retrieve and use rules in a conscious, effortful
              manner. Several functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)

              vary from study to study. This observation raises the question of
              whether there are distinct classes of rules that are represented
              differentially in the brain. To address this question, an fMRI
              study was conducted in which participants performed two tasks,
              each at two levels of difficulty, during acquisition of
              event-related fMRI data. The response competition task was based

              participants' memory for either one or four previously memorized
              pairs of words. On each trial, an instructional cue appeared
              briefly on the screen, followed by an 8-sec delay and a probe
              period. The left ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) and the left
              supplementary motor area (SMA)/pre-SMA were engaged during the

               time-consuming control processes required for task switching.
               Previous results of other paradigms investigating cognitive
               control processes suggested that prefrontal cortex is involved
               in executive control. We used event-related fMRI to investigate

              operations. When subjects switch between tasks, they must both
              inhibit the previous task and re-engage in a different task.
              Inhibition of the disengaged task remains active for a period of
              time and has to be overcome when re-engaging in the same task.
              Here we used a task-switching paradigm that allows distinction of
              two control processes: overcoming the inhibition of a previously
              performed task when re-engaging it and restarting a sequence of
              tasks after a period of interruption. Behaviorally, these
              processes were reflected in the facts that: (i) switching to a
              recently performed task, that is thus unlikely to have fully
              recovered from inhibition, takes longer than switching to a task
              less recently performed and (ii) re-engaging in a sequence of
              tasks after a period of interruption transiently increases
              response time. Using event-related functional MRI, we found that

              and estimates the single position in the visual field that
              produces the largest response. The new method computes a model of

              stimuli and estimates the visual field map as well as other
              neuronal population properties, such as receptive field size and

              are more accurate than those obtained using conventional visual
              field mapping, and we trace with high precision the visual field
              maps to the center of the foveal representation. We report

               transcranial stimulation, and (2) assess the magnitude and
               spread of cortical electric field with a novel High-Definition

               Stimulation (TES) over primary motor cortex (M1) was delivered
               using the 4 ?? 1 montage (4 ?? cathode, surrounding a single
               central anode; montage radius ~ 3. cm) with sufficient intensity
               to elicit a discrete muscle twitch in the hand. The estimated
               current distribution in M1 was calculated using the
               individualized MRI-based model, and compared with the observed
               motor response across subjects. The response magnitude was
               quantified with stimulation over motor cortex as well as
               anterior and posterior to motor cortex. In each case the model
               data were consistent with the motor response across subjects.
               The estimated cortical electric fields with the 4 ?? 1 montage
               were compared (area, magnitude, direction) for TES and tDCS in

               area. Computational models predict that both TES and tDCS
               waveforms using the 4 ?? 1-Ring configuration generate electric
               fields in cortex with comparable gross current distribution, and

              timeline visualization for overviews and an influence
              visualization for detailed views. The timeline displays the
              general chronology and importance of authors and articles in a
              citation database, whereas the influence visualization is
              implemented using the Growing Polygons technique, suitably
              modified to the context of browsing citation data. Using the
              latter technique, hierarchies of articles with potentially very
              long citation chains can be graphically represented. The
              visualization is augmented with mechanisms for parentchild
              visualization and suitable interaction techniques for interacting
              with the view hierarchy and the individual articles in the
              dataset. We also provide an interactive concept map for keywords
              and co-authorship using a basic force-directed graph layout

  abstract  = "One of the most fundamental properties of human primary visual
               cortex (V1) is its retinotopic organization, which??makes it an
               ideal candidate for encoding spatial properties, such as size,
               of objects. However, three-dimensional (3D) contextual
               information can lead to size illusions that are reflected in the
               spatial pattern of activity in V1 [1]. A critical question is
               how complex 3D contextual information can influence spatial
               activity patterns in V1. Here, we assessed whether changes in
               the spatial distribution of activity in V1 depend on the focus
               of attention, which would be suggestive of feedback of 3D
               contextual information from higher visual areas. We presented
               two 3D rings at close and far apparent depths in??a??3D scene.
               When subjects fixated its center, the far ring appeared to be
               larger and occupy a more eccentric portion of the visual field,
               relative to the close ring. Using functional magnetic resonance
               imaging, we found that the spatial distribution of V1??activity
               induced by the far ring was also shifted toward??a more
               eccentric representation of the visual field, whereas that
               induced by the close ring was shifted toward the foveal
               representation, consistent with their perceptual appearances.
               This effect was significantly reduced when the focus of spatial
               attention was narrowed with a demanding central fixation task.
               We reason that focusing attention on the fixation task resulted
               in reduced activity in-and therefore reduced feedback
               from-higher visual areas that process the 3D depth cues. ?? 2008

              people never experience the same situation twice, they can only
              construct priors by generalizing from similar past experiences.
              Here we examine the generalization of priors over stochastic
              visuomotor perturbations in reaching experiments. In particular,
              we look into how the first two moments of the prior--the mean and
              variance (uncertainty)--generalize. We find that uncertainty
              appears to generalize differently from the mean of the prior, and
              an interesting asymmetry arises when the mean and the uncertainty

               partially affect activity-dependent BDNF secretion impairs motor

  abstract = "Visual detection and discrimination thresholds are often measured
              using adaptive staircases, and most studies use transformed (or
              weighted) up/down methods with fixed step sizes - in the spirit
              of Wetherill and Levitt - instead of changing step size at each
              trial in accordance with best-placement rules - in the spirit of
              Watson and Pelli. It is generally assumed that a fixed-step-size
              (FSS) staircase converges on the stimulus level at which a
              correct response occurs with the probabilities derived by
              Wetherill and Levitt or Kaernbach, but this has never been proved
              rigorously. This work used simulation techniques to determine the
              asymptotic and small-sample convergence of FSS staircases as a
              function of such parameters as the up/down rule, the size of the
              steps up or down, the starting stimulus level, or the spread of
              the psychometric function. The results showed that the asymptotic
              convergence of FSS staircases depends much more on the sizes of
              the steps than it does on the up/down rule. Yet, if the size ??+
              of a step up differs from the size ??- of a step down in a way
              that the ratio ??-/??+ is constant at a specific value that
              changes with up/down rule, then convergence percent-correct is
              unaffected by the absolute sizes of the steps. For use with the
              popular one-, two-, three- and four-down/one-up rules, these
              ratios must respectively be set at 0.2845, 0.5488, 0.7393 and
              0.8415, rendering staircases that converge on the 77.85\%-,
              80.35\%-, 83.15\%- and 85.84\%-correct points. Wetherill and
              Levitt's transformed up/down rules - which require ??-/??+ = 1 -
              and the general version of Kaernbach's weighted up/down rule -
              which allows any ??-/??+ ratio - fail to reach their presumed
              targets. The small-sample study showed that, even with the
              optimal settings, short FSS staircases (up to 20 reversals in
              length) are subject to some bias, and their precision is less
              than reasonable, but their characteristics improve when the size
              ??+ of a step up is larger than half the spread of the

               all, how the brain is able to create the richness and complexity
               of human behavior is still largely mysterious. What better
               choice to study that complexity than to study it in humans?
               However, measurements of brain activity typically need to be
               made non-invasively which puts severe constraints on what can be
               learned about the internal workings of the brain. Our approach
               has been to use a combination of psychophysics in which we can
               use human behavioral flexibility to make quantitative
               measurements of behavior and link those through computational
               models to measurements of cortical activity through magnetic
               resonance imaging. In particular, we have tested various
               computational hypotheses about what neural mechanisms could
               account for behavioral enhancement with spatial attention
               (Pestilli et al., 2011). Resting both on quantitative
               measurements and considerations of what is known through animal
               models, we concluded that weighting of sensory signals by the
               magnitude of their response is a neural mechanism for efficient
               selection of sensory signals and consequent improvements in
               behavioral performance with attention. While animal models have
               many technical advantages over studying the brain in humans, we

               validate, replicate and extend basic knowledge learned from
               animal model systems and thus form a bridge to understanding how

              to recenter contrast response functions around the ambient

              succession at two or more locations, perception strikingly
              shrinks the intervening distance, and expands the elapsed time,
              between consecutive events. The origins of these perceptual
              space-time distortions are
              unknown.\textbackslashn\textbackslashnMETHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
              FINDINGS: Here I show that these illusory effects, which I term
              perceptual length contraction and time dilation, are emergent
              properties of a Bayesian observer model that incorporates prior
              expectation for speed. Rapidly moving stimuli violate
              expectation, provoking perceptual length contraction and time
              dilation. The Bayesian observer replicates the cutaneous rabbit
              illusion, the tau effect, the kappa effect, and other
              spatiotemporal illusions. Additionally, it shows realistic
              tactile temporal order judgment and spatial attention
              effects.\textbackslashn\textbackslashnCONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
              The remarkable explanatory power of this simple model supports
              the hypothesis, first proposed by Helmholtz, that the brain
              biases perception in favor of expectation. Specifically, the
              results suggest that the brain automatically incorporates prior
              expectation for speed in order to overcome spatial and temporal
              imprecision inherent in the sensorineural signal.",

              greater responses to their preferred face than to nonpreferred
              faces, particularly in posterior face areas. Anterior face areas
              instead displayed tuning for face categories: voxels in these

              studied directly by fMRI due to its limited spatial resolution.
              Here, we circumvented this limitation by using fMR adaptation,
              namely, reduction of the fMR signal due to repeated presentation
              of identical images. Object-selective regions (lateral occipital
              complex [LOC]) showed a monotonic signal decrease as repetition
              frequency increased. The invariant properties of fMR adaptation
              were studied by presenting the same object in different viewing
              conditions. LOC exhibited stronger fMR adaptation to changes in
              size and position (more invariance) compared to illumination and
              viewpoint. The effect revealed two putative subdivisions within
              LOC: caudal-dorsal (LO), which exhibited substantial recovery
              from adaptation under all transformations, and posterior fusiform
              (PF/LOa), which displayed stronger adaptation. This study

  abstract = "Since Libet's seminal observation that a brain potential related
              to movement preparation occurs before participants report to be
              aware of their movement intention, it has been debated whether
              consciousness has causal influence on movement decisions. Here we
              review recent advances that provide new insights into the
              dynamics of human decision-making and question the validity of
              different markers used for determining the onset of neural and
              conscious events. Motor decisions involve multiple stages of goal
              evaluation, intention formation, and action execution. While the
              validity of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP) as index of neural
              movement preparation is controversial, improved neural markers
              are able to predict decision outcome even at early stages.
              Participants report being conscious of their decisions only at
              the time of final intention formation, just before the primary
              motor cortex starts executing the chosen action. However,
              accumulating evidence suggests that this is an artifact of
              Libet's clock method used for assessing consciousness. More
              refined methods suggest that intention consciousness does not
              appear instantaneously but builds up progressively. In this view,
              early neural markers of decision outcome are not unconscious but
              simply reflect conscious goal evaluation stages which are not
              final yet and therefore not reported with the clock method.
              Alternatives to the Libet clock are discussed that might allow
              for assessment of consciousness during decision making with

               learning challenges the executive control system of memory
               processes as the erroneous items compete with the correct items

               (DLPFC) is a core region involved in this executive control
               system. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can

               received anodal and another group cathodal tDCS of the left
               DLPFC each compared to sham stimulation. Participants had to
               learn words in an errorless and an errorful manner using a word

               compared to errorful learning had a profound effect on the
               memory performance in terms of quality. Anodal stimulation of
               the left DLPFC did not modulate the memory performance following
               errorless or errorful learning. By contrast, cathodal

              vary in specificity; a single location, a subset of locations, or
              all locations may be of potential importance. Using a
              contrast-discrimination task with four possible targets, we asked
              whether performance benefits are graded with the spatial
              specificity of a prior cue and whether we could quantitatively
              account for behavioral performance with cortical activ- ity
              changes measured by blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
              imaging. Thus we changed the prior probability that each location
              contained the target from 100 to 50 to 25\% by cueing in advance
              1, 2, or 4 of the possible locations. We found that behavioral
              perfor- mance (discrimination thresholds) improved in a graded
              fashion with spatial specificity. However, concurrently measured
              cortical responses from retinotopically defined visual areas were
              not strictly graded; response magnitude decreased when all 4
              locations were cued (25\% prior probability) relative to the 100
              and 50\% prior probability conditions, but no significant

              attention on contrast-response (e.g., contrast-gain,
              response-gain, additive-offset dependent on visibility), while
              functional imaging measurements have more uniformly reported
              increases in response across all contrasts (additive-offset). The
              normalization model of attention elegantly predicts the diversity
              of effects of attention reported in single-units well-tuned to
              the stimulus, but what predictions does it make for more
              realistic populations of neurons with heterogeneous tuning? Are
              predictions in accordance with population-scale measurements? We
              used functional imaging data from humans to determine a realistic
              ratio of attention-field to stimulus-drive size (a key parameter
              for the model) and predicted effects of attention in a population
              of model neurons with heterogeneous tuning. We found that within
              the population, neurons well-tuned to the stimulus showed a
              response-gain effect, while less-well-tuned neurons showed a
              contrast-gain effect. Averaged across the population, these
              disparate effects of attention gave rise to additive-offsets in
              contrast-response, similar to reports in human functional imaging
              as well as population averages of single-units. Differences in
              predictions for single-units and populations were observed across
              a wide range of model parameters (ratios of attention-field to

              in tuning of realistic neuronal populations, the normalization
              model of attention can not only predict responses of well-tuned
              neurons, but also the activity of large populations of neurons.
              More generally, computational models can unify physiological
              findings across different scales of measurement, and make links
              to behavior, but only if factors such as heterogeneous tuning

  abstract = "Perception reflects an integration of ``bottom-up''
              (sensory-driven) and ``top-down'' (internally generated) signals.
              Although models of visual processing often emphasize the central
              role of feed-forward hierarchical processing, less is known about
              the impact of top-down signals on complex visual representations.
              Here, we investigated whether and how the observer's goals
              modulate object processing across the cortex. We examined
              responses elicited by a diverse set of objects under six distinct
              tasks, focusing on either physical (e.g., color) or conceptual
              properties (e.g., man-made). Critically, the same stimuli were
              presented in all tasks, allowing us to investigate how task
              impacts the neural representations of identical visual input. We
              found that task has an extensive and differential impact on
              object processing across the cortex. First, we found
              task-dependent representations in the ventral temporal and
              prefrontal cortex. In particular, although object identity could
              be decoded from the multivoxel response within task, there was a
              significant reduction in decoding across tasks. In contrast, the
              early visual cortex evidenced equivalent decoding within and
              across tasks, indicating task-independent representations.
              Second, task information was pervasive and present from the
              earliest stages of object processing. However, although the
              responses of the ventral temporal, prefrontal, and parietal
              cortex enabled decoding of both the type of task
              (physical/conceptual) and the specific task (e.g., color), the
              early visual cortex was not sensitive to type of task and could
              only be used to decode individual physical tasks. Thus, object
              processing is highly influenced by the behavioral goal of the
              observer, highlighting how top-down signals constrain and inform
              the formation of visual representations.",

              indicate a potential upcoming crash. If further activity at the
              brake pedal is detected, the system automatically performs
              emergency braking. Here, we present the results of a driving
              simulator study indicating that the driver's intention to perform
              emergency braking can be detected based on muscle activation and
              cerebral activity prior to the behavioural response. Identical
              levels of predictive accuracy were attained using
              electroencephalography (EEG), which worked more quickly than
              electromyography (EMG), and using EMG, which worked more quickly
              than pedal dynamics. A simulated assistance system using EEG and
              EMG was found to detect emergency brakings 130 ms earlier than a
              system relying only on pedal responses. At 100 km h(-1) driving
              speed, this amounts to reducing the braking distance by 3.66 m.
              This result motivates a neuroergonomic approach to driving

              event-related potential signature that comprised components

              natural images as stimuli, we randomly varied relative contrast
              amplitude at different spatial frequencies and had human subjects
              determine which images had higher contrast. Then, we determined
              how the random variations corresponded with the human judgments.
              We found that the overall contrast of an image is
              disproportionately determined by how much contrast is between 1
              and 6 c/ degrees , around the peak of the contrast sensitivity

              task-relevant item. But what happens when an item outside the
              primary focus of attention is also relevant to the task at hand?
              In a dual-task fMRI experiment, we studied the responses in
              retinotopically organized visual cortex in such a situation.
              Observers performed an attention-demanding task in the fovea
              while another, unmasked stimulus appeared in the visual
              periphery. With respect to this latter stimulus, observers
              attempted to perform either a less or a more attentionally
              demanding task. Both tasks increased the BOLD response to the
              peripheral stimulus. Behaviorally, however, only the less
              demanding task was performed well, whereas the demanding task was
              carried out near chance. What could explain the discrepancy
              between BOLD response and behavioral performance? A control
              experiment revealed that the report of the less demanding feature

              queried by the demanding task had a significantly shorter iconic

              the focus of attention initially remains with the foveal task,
              but subsequently shifts to the former location of the peripheral
              stimulus. Such a belated shift to a peripheral iconic memory
              (futile in one case, informative in the other) would reconcile
              the similar BOLD response with the disparate behavioral
              performance. In summary, our results show that an enhanced BOLD

              target stimuli that occur infrequently and irregularly within a
              series of standard stimuli. Although detection of these targets
              reliably evokes transient activity in prefrontal cortical
              regions, it has not been established whether this activity is due
              to selection of an infrequent response or to changes in response
              strategy. We investigated this issue using a novel variant of the
              oddball task that incorporated the Simon effect, while measuring
              hemodynamic brain activity in prefrontal cortex using functional
              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects viewed a series of
              circles and squares that required left and right button presses,
              respectively. On 90\% of trials (``standard'' trials), the
              stimuli were presented in the same visual hemifield as the hand
              of response, but on 10\% of trials (``strategy-change'' trials)
              they were presented in the opposite visual hemifield. Significant
              activation to the infrequent strategy-change trials was found in
              the anterior middle frontal gyrus (MFG), the posterior inferior
              frontal gyrus (IFG) and adjacent insular cortex, and in the
              anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG). These regions, which correspond
              to previous reports of oddball-related activation, were
              consistent across subjects. Behavioral results supported our
              interpretation that subjects potentiated a position-based
              response strategy, which was inhibited on the strategy-change
              trials. Activity within the MFG and ACG was much greater on error
              trials than on correct trials, while IFG activity was similar

              changes in the mapping of stimuli to responses (e.g. response
              strategies), independently of any changes in behavior. ?? 2003

              provide a causal link between a function or behaviour and a

              subjects to attend to either the faces' emotional expression or
              to the glasses' shape, we assessed whether angry facial
              expressions were processed when they were unattended and
              task-irrelevant.\textbackslashn\textbackslashnMETHODS: We
              conducted a distributed source analysis on the corresponding
              event-related potentials focused on the early activity of face
              processing and attention networks' related areas. We also
              evaluated the magnitude of the affective priming
              effect.\textbackslashn\textbackslashnRESULTS: We observed a
              reduction of occipitotemporal areas' (BA37) activation to
              unattended compared to attended faces and a modulation of primary
              visual areas' activity lateralization. The latter was more right
              lateralized for attended than for unattended faces, and emotional
              faces were more right lateralized than neutral ones only in the
              former condition. Affective priming disappeared when emotional
              expressions of prime faces were ignored. Moreover, an increased
              activation in the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), but not
              in the intraparietal sulcus, was observed only for unattended
              angry facial expressions at ∼170 ms after face
              presentation.\textbackslashn\textbackslashnCONCLUSION: We suggest
              that attentional resources affect the early processing in visual
              and occipito-temporal areas, irrespective of the faces'
              threatening content. The disappearance of the affective priming
              effect suggests that when subjects were asked to focus on
              glasses' shape, attentional resources were not available to
              process the facial emotional expression, even though
              emotion-relevant and emotion-irrelevant features of the face were
              presented in the same position. On the other hand, unattended
              angry faces evoked a pre-attentive TPJ activity, which most
              likely represents a bottom-up trigger that signals their high

              Frequently, long-term survivors of childhood cancer report late
              cancer-related effects that diminish quality of life and increase
              the risk of early mortality. Risk-based health care that involves
              a personalized plan for surveillance, screening, and prevention
              is recommended to reduce cancer-related morbidity in childhood
              cancer survivors. To implement optimal risk-based care, the
              survivor and health care provider must have accurate information
              about cancer diagnosis, treatment modalities, and potential
              cancer-related health risks to guide screening and risk-reducing
              interventions. However, previous studies evaluating health
              knowledge of childhood cancer survivors demonstrate noteworthy
              deficits and misperceptions about their cancer diagnosis,
              treatment, and cancer-related health risks. In addition, because
              of the relative rarity of childhood cancer, many health care
              providers lack familiarity with cancer-related health risks and
              risk-reduction methods relevant for this population. To correct
              these deficits, the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network
              (SIGN) and the Children's Oncology Group (COG) developed clinical
              practice guidelines to foster appropriate risk-based survivor

  abstract = "In Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning, reward typically
              comes seconds after reward-triggering actions, creating an
              explanatory conundrum known as ``distal reward problem'': How
              does the brain know what firing patterns of what neurons are
              responsible for the reward if 1) the patterns are no longer there
              when the reward arrives and 2) all neurons and synapses are
              active during the waiting period to the reward? Here, we show how
              the conundrum is resolved by a model network of cortical spiking
              neurons with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) modulated
              by dopamine (DA). Although STDP is triggered by nearly coincident
              firing patterns on a millisecond timescale, slow kinetics of
              subsequent synaptic plasticity is sensitive to changes in the
              extracellular DA concentration during the critical period of a
              few seconds. Random firings during the waiting period to the
              reward do not affect STDP and hence make the network insensitive
              to the ongoing activity-the key feature that distinguishes our
              approach from previous theoretical studies, which implicitly
              assume that the network be quiet during the waiting period or
              that the patterns be preserved until the reward arrives. This
              study emphasizes the importance of precise firing patterns in
              brain dynamics and suggests how a global diffusive reinforcement
              signal in the form of extracellular DA can selectively influence

  author   = "James, Thomas W and Humphrey, G Keith and Gati, Joseph S and
              Menon, Ravi S and Goodale, Melvyn A",
  abstract = "Background: Recognizing an object is improved by recent
              experience with that object even if one cannot recall seeing the
              object. This perceptual facilitation as a result of previous
              experience is called priming. In neuroimaging studies, priming is
              often associated with a decrease in activation in brain regions
              involved in object recognition. It is thought that this occurs
              because priming causes a sharpening of object representations
              which leads to more efficient processing and, consequently, a
              reduction in neural activity. Recent evidence has suggested,
              however, that the apparent effect of priming on brain activation
              may vary as a function of whether the neural activity is measured
              before or after recognition has taken place. Results: Using a
              gradual 'unmasking' technique, we presented primed and non-primed
              objects to subjects, and measured activation time courses using
              high-field functional magnetic, resonance imaging (fMRI). As the
              objects were slowly revealed, but before recognition had
              occurred, activation increased from baseline level to a peak that
              corresponded in time to the subjects' behavioural recognition
              responses. The activation peak for primed objects occurred sooner
              than the peak for non-primed objects, and subjects responded
              sooner when presented with a primed object than with a non-primed
              object. During this pre-recognition phase, primed objects
              produced more activation than non-primed objects. After
              recognition, activation declined rapidly for both primed and
              non-primed objects, but now activation was lower for the primed
              objects. Conclusions: Priming did not produce a general decrease
              in activation in the brain regions involved in object recognition
              but, instead, produced a shift in the time of peak activation
              that corresponded to the shift in time seen in the subjects'
              behavioural recognition performance.",

  abstract = "Attentional selection plays a critical role in conscious
              perception. When attention is diverted, even salient stimuli fail
              to reach visual awareness [1, 2]. Attention can be voluntarily
              directed to a spatial location [3-9] or a visual feature [9-14]
              for facilitating the processing of information relevant to
              current goals. In everyday situations, attention and awareness
              are tightly coupled. This has led some to suggest that attention
              and awareness might be based on a common neural foundation [15,
              16], whereas others argue that they are mediated by distinct
              mechanisms [17-19]. A body of evidence shows that visual stimuli
              can be processed at multiple stages of the visual-processing
              streams without evoking visual awareness [20-22]. To illuminate
              the relationship between visual attention and conscious
              perception, we investigated whether top-down attention can target
              and modulate the neural representations of unconsciously
              processed visual stimuli. Our experiments show that spatial
              attention can target only consciously perceived stimuli, whereas
              feature-based attention can modulate the processing of invisible
              stimuli. The attentional modulation of unconscious signals
              implies that attention and awareness can be dissociated,

  abstract  = "Behavioral research in cognitive psychology provides evidence
               for an important distinction between immediate performance that
               accompanies practice and long-term performance that reflects the
               relative permanence in the capability for the practiced skill
               (i.e. learning). This learning-performance distinction is
               strikingly evident when challenging practice conditions may
               impair practice performance, but enhance long-term retention of
               motor skills. A review of motor learning studies with a specific
               focus on comparing differences in performance between that at
               the end of practice and at delayed retention suggests that the
               delayed retention or transfer performance is a better indicator
               of motor learning than the performance at (or end of) practice.
               This provides objective evidence for the learning-performance
               distinction. This behavioral evidence coupled with an
               understanding of the motor memory processes of encoding,
               consolidation and retrieval may provide insight into the
               putative mechanism that implements the learning-performance

               course of practice and delayed retention frequently used in
               behavioral motor learning paradigms. In the context of the

               and specific cortical brain regions engaged in motor performance

              punished entirely too much for what they did. They wanted to have
              a good time, but they were like children playing in the street;
              they could see one after another of them being killed--run over,
              maimed, destroyed--but they continued to play anyhow. We really
              all were very happy for a while, sitting around not toiling but
              just bullshitting and playing, but it was for such a terrible
              brief time, and then the punishment was beyond belief: even when
              we could see it, we could not believe it. For example, while I
              was writing this I learned that the person on whom the character
              Jerry Fabin is based killed himself. My friend on whom I based
              the character Ernie Luckman died before I began the novel. For a
              while I myself was one of these children playing in the street; I
              was, like the rest of them, trying to play instead of being grown
              up, and I was punished. I am on the list below, which is a list
              of those to whom this novel is dedicated, and what became of
              each. Drug misuse is not a disease, it is a decision, like the
              decision to step out in front of a moving car. You would call
              that not a disease but an error in judgment. When a bunch of
              people begin to do it, it is a social error, a life-style. In
              this particular life-style the motto is ``Be happy now because
              tomorrow you are dying,'' but the dying begins almost at once,
              and the happiness is a memory. It is, then, only a speeding up,
              an intensifying, of the ordinary human existence. It is not
              different from your life-style, it is only faster. It all takes
              place in days or weeks or months instead of years. ``Take the
              cash and let the credit go,'' as Villon said in 1460. But that is
              a mistake if the cash is a penny and the credit a whole lifetime.
              There is no moral in this novel; it is not bourgeois; it does not
              say they were wrong to play when they should have toiled; it just
              tells what the consequences were. In Greek drama they were
              beginning, as a society, to discover science, which means causal
              law. Here in this novel there is Nemesis: not fate, because any
              one of us could have chosen to stop playing in the street, but,
              as I narrate from the deepest part of my life and heart, a
              dreadful Nemesis for those who kept on playing. I myself, I am
              not a character in this novel; I am the novel. So, though, was
              our entire nation at this time. This novel is about more people
              than I knew personally. Some we all read about in the newspapers.
              It was, this sitting around with our buddies and bullshitting
              while making tape recordings, the bad decision of the decade, the
              sixties, both in and out of the establishment. And nature cracked
              down on us. We were forced to stop by things dreadful. If there
              was any ``sin,'' it was that these people wanted to keep on
              having a good time forever, and were punished for that, but, as I
              say, I feel that, if so, the punishment was far too great, and I

               research suggests that feelings of being in the zone are
               strongest when the demand posed by a task matches one's level of
               ability (i.e., the balance hypothesis). In the present article,
               we tested this hypothesis using a novel experimental paradigm.
               By collecting numerous zone judgments for each participant, we
               were able to examine intra-individual sources of variance that
               explain why people often feel more or less in-the-zone on the
               same task from one moment to the next. The results of two
               experiments provide support for what we have termed the
               balance-plus hypothesis, which posits that zone experiences are
               strongest (Experiments 1-2) and have the greatest motivational
               force (Experiment 2) when the balance between task demand and

              blocks, predictable task-switching and task-cuing paradigms,

              2nd part, we discuss findings on preparatory control mechanisms
              in task switching and theoretical accounts of task preparation.
              We consider preparation processes in two-stage models, consider
              preparation as an all-or-none process, address the question of
              whether preparation is switch-specific, reflect on preparation as

              movements in each record. At times artifacts were superimposed

              as was possible, eliminated. Voluntary hand or foot movements are
              preoeded by a slowly increasing sur/ace- negative cortical
              potential of 10--15 \#V, called read\textcent{}ness potential.
              This potential is maximal over the contralateral precentral

              memory results in generalization). We expose a fundamental, but
              neglected, tension between prevailing computational theories that
              emphasize the function of the hippocampus in pattern separation
              (Marr, 1971; McClelland, McNaughton, \& O'Reilly, 1995), and
              empirical support for its role in generalization and flexible
              relational memory (Cohen \& Eichenbaum, 1993; Eichenbaum, 1999).
              Our account provides a means by which to resolve this conflict,
              by demonstrating that the basic representational scheme
              envisioned by complementary learning systems theory (McClelland
              et al., 1995), which relies upon orthogonalized codes in the
              hippocampus, is compatible with efficient generalization-as long

              hippocampal circuit or, more widely, between the hippocampus and

              process that facilitates the discovery of higher-order
              relationships between a set of related experiences, expands the
              scope of classical exemplar-based models of memory (e.g.,
              Nosofsky, 1984) and allows the hippocampus to support

              not aware. Here we give a brief review of this research, discuss
              possible reasons for inconsistencies in the empirical evidence,

              suggest to differentiate cognitive control evoked either because
              of explicit or because of implicit control cues. While the former
              type of control seems to work outside of awareness, the latter

              induces long-lasting NMDA receptor-dependent cortical plasticity
              via persistent subthreshold polarization of neuronal membranes.
              Conventional bipolar tDCS is applied with two large (35 cm2)
              rectangular electrodes, resulting in directional modulation of
              neuronal excitability. Recently a newly designed 4 ?? 1
              high-definition (HD) tDCS protocol was proposed for more focal
              stimulation according to the results of computational modeling.
              HD tDCS utilizes small disc electrodes deployed in 4 ?? 1 ring
              configuration whereby the physiological effects of the induced
              electric field are thought to be grossly constrained to the
              cortical area circumscribed by the ring. Objective: We aim to
              compare the physiological effects of both tDCS electrode
              arrangements on motor cortex excitability. Methods: tDCS was
              applied with 2 mA for 10 min. Fourteen healthy subjects
              participated, and motor cortex excitability was monitored by
              transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) before and after tDCS.
              Results: Excitability enhancement following anodal and a
              respective reduction after cathodal stimulation occurred in both,
              conventional and HD tDCS. However, the plastic changes showed a
              more delayed peak at 30 min and longer lasting after-effects for
              more than 2 h after HD tDCS for both polarities, as compared to
              conventional tDCS. Conclusion: The results show that this new
              electrode arrangement is efficient for the induction of
              neuroplasticity in the primary motor cortex. The pattern of
              aftereffects might be compatible with the concept of

              existence, and clear social implications, this aspect of
              self-control has proved hard to study experimentally. One recent
              study used a perceptual timing paradigm to identify specific

              with voluntary inhibition of action (Brass and Haggard 2007: J

              task that gives participants a strong reason to inhibit or to
              execute actions, and therefore involves self-control in the sense
              of voluntary inhibition of prepotent impulsive responses. Second,
              we investigated the relation between dFMC and other
              cognitive-motor areas using effective connectivity analysis. We
              show that dFMC is activated when inhibiting prepared responses to

              that it allows intentional inhibition of action through top-down

              of perspective-taking and cognitive appraisal while participants
              observed the facial expression of pain resulting from medical

              was manipulated by providing information that the medical

              more voluntary cortical processing. Here we examined whether
              irrelevant faces with varied emotional expressions interfere with
              a covert attention task in macaque monkeys. In the task, the
              monkeys monitored a target grating in the periphery for a subtle
              color change while ignoring distracters that included faces
              appearing elsewhere on the screen. The onset time of distracter
              faces before the target change, as well as their spatial
              proximity to the target, was varied from trial to trial. The
              presence of faces, especially faces with emotional expressions
              interfered with the task, indicating a competition for
              attentional resources between the task and the face stimuli.
              However, this interference was significant only when faces were
              presented for greater than 200 ms. Emotional faces also affected
              saccade velocity and reduced pupillary reflex. Our results
              indicate that the attraction of attention by emotional faces in

              possibly involving cortical--subcortical interactions. Intranasal
              application of the hormone oxytocin ameliorated the interfering

              the presupplementary motor area after the execution of a simple
              spontaneous action shifted the perceived onset of the motor
              intention backward in time, and shifted the perceived time of
              action execution forward in time. The size of the effect was
              similar regardless of whether TMS was applied immediately after
              the action or 200 msec after. The results of three control

  abstract = "Background: Since motor learning is a key component for stroke
              recovery, enhancing motor skill learning is a crucial challenge
              for neurorehabilitation. Transcranial direct current stimulation
              (tDCS) is a promising approach for improving motor learning. The
              aim of this trial was to test the hypothesis that dual-tDCS
              applied bilaterally over the primary motor cortices (M1) improves
              online motor skill learning with the paretic hand and its
              long-term retention. Methods: Eighteen chronic stroke patients
              participated in a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled,
              double bind trial. During separate sessions, dual-tDCS or sham
              dual-tDCS was applied over 30 min while stroke patients learned a
              complex visuomotor skill with the paretic hand: using a computer
              mouse to move a pointer along a complex circuit as quickly and
              accurately as possible. A learning index involving the evolution
              of the speed/accuracy trade-off was calculated. Performance of
              the motor skill was measured at baseline, after intervention and
              1 week later. Results: After sham dual-tDCS, eight patients
              showed performance worsening. In contrast, dual-tDCS enhanced the
              amount and speed of online motor skill learning compared to sham
              (p < 0.001) in all patients; this superiority was maintained
              throughout the hour following. The speed/accuracy trade-off was
              shifted more consistently after dual-tDCS (n = 10) than after
              sham (n = 3). More importantly, 1 week later, online enhancement
              under dual-tDCS had translated into superior long-term retention
              (+44\%) compared to sham (+4\%). The improvement generalized to a
              new untrained circuit and to digital dexterity. Conclusion: A
              single-session of dual-tDCS, applied while stroke patients
              trained with the paretic hand significantly enhanced online motor
              skill learning both quantitatively and qualitatively, leading to
              successful long-term retention and generalization. The
              combination of motor skill learning and dual-tDCS is promising
              for improving post-stroke neurorehabilitation.",

              precedes a freely voluntary, fully endogenous motor act was
              directly compared with the reportable time (W) for appearance of
              the subjective experience of `wanting' or intending to act. The
              onset of cerebral activity clearly preceded by at least several
              hundred milliseconds the reported time of conscious intention to
              act. This relationship held even for those series (with `type II'
              RPs) in which subjects reported that all of the 40 self-initiated
              movements in the series appeared `spontaneously' and
              capriciously. Data were obtained in at least 6 different
              experimental sessions with each of 5 subjects. In series with
              type II RPs, onset of the main negative shift in each RP preceded
              the corresponding mean W value by an average of about 350 ms, and
              by a minimum of about 150 ms. In series with type I RPs, in which
              an experience of preplanning occurred in some of the 40
              self-initiated acts, onset of RP preceded W by an average of
              about 800 ms (or by 500 ms, taking onset of RP at 90 per cent of
              its area). Reports of W time depended upon the subject's recall
              of the spatial `clock-position' of a revolving spot at the time
              of his initial awareness of wanting or intending to move. Two
              different modes of recall produced similar values. Subjects
              distinguished awareness of wanting to move (W) from awareness of
              actually moving (M). W times were consistently and substantially
              negative to, in advance of, mean times reported for M and also

              stimulus delivered at irregular times that were unknown to the
              subject. It is concluded that cerebral initiation of a
              spontaneous, freely voluntary act can begin unconsciously, that
              is, before there is any (at least recallable) subjective
              awareness that a `decision' to act has already been initiated

              whether such spatial clusters are elongated normal to the
              cortical surface so as to form speed columns. Our data showed
              that \{MT\} neurons are indeed clustered according to preferred
              speed. Multiunit recordings were speed tuned, and the speed
              tuning of these signals was well correlated with the speed tuning
              of single neurons recorded simultaneously. To determine whether
              speed columns exist in \{MT,\} we compared the rates at which
              preferred speed changed in electrode tracks that traversed \{MT\}

              intervals can usefully supplement, or even replace, standard
              hypothesis-testing procedures. We note that most social science
              statistics textbooks limit discussion of confidence intervals to
              their use in between-subject designs. Our central purpose in this
              article is to describe how to compute an analogous confidence
              interval that can be used in within-subject designs. This
              confidence interval rests on the reasoning that because
              between-subject variance typically plays no role in statistical
              analyses of within-subject designs, it can legitimately be
              ignored; hence, an appropriate confidence interval can be based
              on the standard within-subject error term-that is, on the
              variability due to the subject x condition interaction.
              Computation of such a confidence interval is simple and is
              embodied in Equation 2 on p. 482 of this article. This confidence
              interval has two useful properties. First, it is based on the
              same error term as is the corresponding analysis of variance, and
              hence leads to comparable conclusions. Second, it is related by a
              known factor ( radical2) to a confidence interval of the
              difference between sample means; accordingly, it can be used to
              infer the faith one can put in some pattern of sample means as a
              reflection of the underlying pattern of population means. These
              two properties correspond to analogous properties of the more

              treatment goal; however, there is a growing awareness of
              limitations when abstinence is considered the only successful
              outcome. Although this issue has been discussed in research
              settings, new studies on the public health significance of heavy
              drinking (defined as five or more standard drinks per drinking
              day in men, and four or more standard drinks per drinking day in
              women) in the past 10 years suggest that clinical providers
              should consider the value of alternative outcomes besides
              abstinence. A focus on abstinence as the primary outcome fails to
              capture the impact of treatment on reduction in the pattern and
              in the frequency of alcohol consumption. In addition, evaluating
              reduction in drinking as ``positive'' has value for patients as
              an indicator of clinical progress. Measurement of continuous
              variables, such as the quantity and the frequency of alcohol
              consumption, has provided a clearer understanding of the scope of
              alcohol-related morbidity and mortality at the societal level,
              and of the relationship between individual patient
              characteristics and the naturalistic course of alcohol use,
              abuse, and dependence. A review of these characteristics suggests
              that there are clinical benefits associated with reducing heavy

              public health consequences associated with heavy drinking and the

              using reduction in heavy drinking as a meaningful clinical
              indicator of treatment response, and that outcomes be
              individualized to patients' goals and readiness to change.

              activity was examined using a cue-target paradigm in which
              subjects performed task switches that selectively required
              reallocation of attention when tasks changed. There were three
              cue conditions: informative switch, informative repeat, and
              neutral. There were four target conditions: informatively cued
              switch, informatively cued repeat, neutrally cued switch, and

               evidence that it does not (Koch \& Tsuchiya, 2007). Therefore
               the question of the role of attention in iconic memory matters.
               Recent evidence (Persuh, Genzer, \& Melara, 2012), suggests that
               iconic memory does depend on attention. Because of the
               centrality of iconic memory to this debate, we looked again at

              we found neurons whose spiking activities were predictive of the
              spatial location of the selected target (spatial-bias neurons) or
              the size of the chosen reward (reward-bias neurons) before the
              onset of the cue presenting the decision-alternatives, and thus
              before rational deliberation could begin. Their predictive power
              increased as the values the animals associated with the two
              decision alternatives became more similar. The ventral striatum

              simple winner-take-all (WTA) circuit model to account for the

              move to be about 0.2 s before voluntary movement onset. However,
              despite repeated confirmation of the result, their method has
              been criticised for its dependence on self-reported timing and
              subjective memory, and the interpretation has been widely debated
              without general consensus. Here, we show that the mean time of
              the conscious intention to move was 1.42 s before movement,
              estimated based on the subject's real-time decision of whether or

  abstract = "1. Recordings were made from single units in the middle temporal
              visual area (MT) of anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. A
              computer-driven stimulator was used to make quantitative tests of
              selectivity for stimulus direction, speed, and orientation. The
              data were taken from 168 units that were histologically
              identified as being in MT. 2. The results confirm previous
              reports of a high degree of direction selectivity in MT. The
              response above background to stimuli moving in a unit's preferred
              direction was, an average, 10.9 times that to stimuli moving in
              the opposite direction. There was a marked tendency for nearby
              units to have similar preferred directions. 3. Most units were
              also sharply tuned for the speed of stimulus motion. For some
              cells the response fell to less than half-maximal at speeds only
              a factor of two from the optimum; on average, responses were
              greater than half-maximal only over a 7.7-fold range of speed.
              The distribution of preferred speeds for different units was
              unimodal, with a peak near 32 degrees/s; the total range of
              preferred speeds extended from 2 to 256 degrees/s. Nearby units
              generally responded best to similar speeds of motion. 4. Most
              units in MT showed selectivity for stimulus orientation when
              tested with stationary, flashed bars. However, stationary stimuli
              generally elicited only brief responses; when averaged over the
              duration of the stimulus, the responses were much less than those
              to moving stimuli. The preferred orientation was usually, but not
              always, perpendicular to the preferred direction of movement. 5.
              A comparison of the results of the present study with a previous
              quantitative investigation in the owl monkey shows a striking
              similarity in response properties in MT of the two species. 6.
              The presence of both direction and speed selectivity in MT of the
              macaque suggests that this area is more specialized for the
              analysis of visual motion than has been previously recognized.",

               the right anterior superior parietal (r-aSPL) and the right
               posterior superior parietal lobule (r-pSPL) have opposite roles
               in triggering perceptual reversals. It has been proposed that
               these two areas are part of a hierarchical network whose
               dynamics determine perceptual switches. However, how these two
               parietal regions interact with each other and with the rest of
               the brain during bistable perception is not known. Here, we
               investigated such a model by recording brain activity using fMRI
               while participants viewed a bistable structure-from-motion
               stimulus. Using dynamic causal modeling (DCM), we found that

              The stimuli were complex visual patterns and to solve the task,
              the monkeys had to discriminate among the stimuli, maintain a
              memory of the sample stimulus during the delay periods, and
              evaluate whether a test stimulus matched the sample presented
              earlier in the trial. PF cells have properties consistent with a
              role in all three of these operations. Approximately 25\% of the
              cells responded selectively to different visual stimuli. Half of
              the cells showed heightened activity during the delay after the
              sample and, for many of these cells, the magnitude of delay
              activity was selective for different samples. Finally, more than
              half of the cells responded differently to the test stimuli
              depending on whether they matched the sample. Because inferior

  abstract = "Behavioral flexibility provides a very large repertoire of
              actions and strategies, however, it carries a cost: a potential
              interference between different options. The voluntary control of
              behavior starts exactly with the ability of deciding between
              alternatives. Certainly inhibition plays a key role in this
              process. Here we examined the inhibitory control of reaching arm
              movements with the countermanding paradigm. Right-handed human
              subjects were asked to perform speeded reaching movements toward
              a visual target appearing either on the same or opposite side of
              the reaching arm (no-stop trials), but to withhold the commanded
              movement whenever an infrequent stop signal was presented (stop
              trials). As the delay between go and stop signals increased,
              subjects increasingly failed to inhibit the movement. From this
              inhibitory function and the reaction times of movements in
              no-stop trials, we estimated the otherwise unobservable duration
              of the stopping process, the stop signal reaction time (SSRT). We
              found that the SSRT for reaching movements was, on average, 206
              ms and that it varied with the reaching arm and the target
              position even though the stop signal was a central stimulus. In
              fact, subjects were always faster to withhold reaching movements
              toward visual targets appearing on the same side of the reaching
              arm. This behavior strictly parallels the course of the reaction
              times of no-stop trials. These data show that the stop and go
              processes interacting in this countermanding task are
              independent, but most likely influenced by a common factor when
              under the control of the same hemisphere. In addition, we show
              that the point beyond which the response cannot be inhibited, the
              so-called point-of-no-return that divides controlled and

  author   = "Mishkin, Mortimer and Ungerleider, Leslie G",
  abstract = "In Experiments 1 and 2, monkeys received 3-stage operations
              intended to serially disconnect parieto-preoccipital from striate
              cortex. At each stage (unilateral parieto-preoccipital removal,
              contralateral striate removal and posterior callosal transection)
              the monkeys were tested for retention of the landmark task, a
              visuospatial discrimination sensitive to the effects of bilateral
              parieto-preoccipital damage. To check the effectiveness of the
              disconnection, the monkeys were also tested after removal of the
              remaining parieto-preoccipital cortex. The results demonstrated
              that corticocortical inputs from striate cortex are crucial for
              the visuospatial functions of parieto-preoccipital cortex, just
              as they had been shown earlier to be crucial for the pattern
              discrimination functions of inferior temporal cortex. Relative to
              inferior temporal cortex, however, parieto-preoccipital cortex
              was found to be especially dependent on ipsilateral (as compared
              with contralateral) striate inputs. In Experiment 3, monkeys
              received bilateral lesions of either lateral or medial striate
              cortex and were tested on both a pattern discrimination task, to
              assess residual inferior temporal function, and the landmark
              task, to assess residual parieto-preoccipital function. The
              results indicated that the pattern discrimination functions of
              inferior temporal cortex are especially dependent on inputs from
              lateral striate cortex, whereas the visuospatial functions of
              parieto-preoccipital cortex are equally dependent on inputs from
              lateral and medial striate cortex. The relatively greater
              contribution to parieto-preoccipital than to inferior temporal
              cortex made by ipsilateral and medial striate inputs
              (representing contralateral and peripheral visual fields,
              respectively) can also be seen in the receptive field properties
              of parieto-preoccipital and inferior temporal neurons. The
              differences in the organization of striate inputs to these two
              cortical association areas presumably reflect differences in the

              specific attributes of visual stimuli are processed. It has been

              aftereffect, motion aftereffect, and figural aftereffect, are
              modulated by attention. In this study, we investigated the effect
              of visual attention on adaptation to illusory lines. In the first
              experiment, orientation selective adaptation to a peripheral
              illusory line was measured in three conditions: (1) poor
              attention condition in which subjects performed a dual task
              (even-odd judgment) at the fixation point during the adaptation
              period, (2) partial attention condition in which subjects only
              observed successively presented digits at the fixation point and
              did not perform the task during the adaptation period, and (3)
              full attention condition in which no visual stimuli were
              presented at the fixation point. Results showed that the

              during the adaptation period, and tilt aftereffects to attended
              and non-attended illusory lines were compared. The magnitude of

              greater than that to the non-attended illusory line even when

               Conventional anodal transcranial direct current stimulation
               (tDCS) protocols including one stimulation session induce NMDA
               receptor-dependent excitability enhancements lasting for about 1
               h. Objective: We aimed to extend the duration of tDCS effects by
               periodic stimulation, consisting of two stimulation sessions,
               since periodic stimulation protocols are able to induce
               neuroplastic excitability alterations stable for days or weeks,
               termed late phase long term potentiation (l-LTP), in animal
               slice preparations. Since both, l-LTP and long term memory
               formation, require gene expression and protein synthesis, and
               glutamatergic receptor activity modifications, l-LTP might be a
               candidate mechanism for the formation of long term memory.
               Methods: The impact of two consecutive tDCS sessions on cortical
               excitability was probed in the motor cortex of healthy humans,
               and compared to that of a single tDCS session. The second
               stimulation was applied without an interval (temporally
               contiguous tDCS), during the after-effects of the first
               stimulation (during after-effects; 3, or 20 min interval), or
               after the after-effects of the first stimulation had vanished
               (post after-effects; 3 or 24 h interval). Results: The during
               after-effects condition resulted in an initially reduced, but
               then relevantly prolonged excitability enhancement, which was
               blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist. The other conditions
               resulted in an abolishment, or a calcium channel-dependent
               reversal of neuroplasticity. Conclusion: Repeated tDCS within a
               specific time window is able to induce l-LTP-like plasticity in
               the human motor cortex. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

              mapping",
  author   = "Murray, Elisabeth a and Bussey, Timothy J and Wise, Steven P",
  abstract = "In arbitrary visuomotor mapping, an object instructs a particular
              action or target of action, but does so in a particular way. In
              other forms of visuomotor control, the object is either the
              target of action (termed standard mapping) or its location
              provides the information needed for targeting (termed
              transformational mapping). By contrast, in arbitrary mapping, the
              object's location bears no systematic spatial relationship with
              the action. Neuropsychological and neurophysiological
              investigation has, in large part, identified the neural network
              that underlies the rapid acquisition and performance of arbitrary
              visuomotor mappings. This network consists of parts of the
              premotor (PM) and prefrontal (PF) cortex, the hippocampal system
              (HS), and the basal ganglia (BG). Here, we propose specialized
              contributions of the network's different components to its
              overall function. To do so, we invoke the concept of distributed
              information-processing architectures, or modules, which may
              involve a variety of neural structures. According to this view,
              recurrent neural networks involving cortex, basal ganglia, and
              thalamus operate largely in parallel. Each of these interacting
              networks can be termed a cortical-BG module. A large number of
              these modules include PM neurons, and they can be termed PM
              cortical-BG modules. A comparable number include PF neurons,
              termed PF cortical-BG modules. We propose that PM and PF
              cortical-BG modules compute specific object-to-action mappings,
              in which the network learns the action associated with a given
              input. These mappings serve as specific solutions to arbitrary
              visuomotor mapping problems. However, they are also exemplars of
              more abstract rules, such as the knowledge that nonspatial visual
              information (e.g., color) can guide the choice of action. We
              propose that PF cortical-BG modules subserve abstract rules of
              this kind, along with other problem-solving strategies. This view
              should not be taken to imply that the PF network lacks the
              capacity to compute specific mappings, but rather that it has
              higher-order mapping functions in addition to its lower-order
              ones. Furthermore, it seems likely that PF provides PM with
              pertinent sensory information. The hippocampal system appears to
              play a role parallel to that of both neocortical-BG networks
              discussed here. However, in accord with several models, it
              operates mainly in the intermediate term, pending the
              consolidation of the relevant information in those neocortical-BG
              networks.",

              benign to humans is still sometimes heard. It is now well
              established, however, that wood-burning stoves and fireplaces as
              well as wildland and agricultural fires emit significant
              quantities of known health-damaging pollutants, including several
              carcinogenic compounds. Two of the principal gaseous pollutants
              in woodsmoke, CO and NOx, add to the atmospheric levels of these
              regulated gases emitted by other combustion sources. Health
              impacts of exposures to these gases and some of the other
              woodsmoke constituents (e.g., benzene) are well characterized in
              thousands of publications. As these gases are indistinguishable
              no matter where they come from, there is no urgent need to
              examine their particular health implications in woodsmoke. With
              this as the backdrop, this review approaches the issue of why
              woodsmoke may be a special case requiring separate health
              evaluation through two questions. The first question we address

              already regulated in many jurisdictions. The second question we
              address is whether woodsmoke particles pose different levels of
              risk than other ambient particles of similar size. To address
              these two key questions, we examine several topics: the chemical
              and physical nature of woodsmoke; the exposures and epidemiology
              of smoke from wildland fires and agricultural burning, and
              related controlled human laboratory exposures to biomass smoke;
              the epidemiology of outdoor and indoor woodsmoke exposures from
              residential woodburning in developed countries; and the
              toxicology of woodsmoke, based on animal exposures and laboratory
              tests. In addition, a short summary of the exposures and health
              effects of biomass smoke in developing countries is provided as
              an additional line of evidence. In the concluding section, we
              return to the two key issues above to summarize (1) what is
              currently known about the health effects of inhaled woodsmoke at
              exposure levels experienced in developed countries, and (2)
              whether there exists sufficient reason to believe that woodsmoke
              particles are sufficiently different to warrant separate
              treatment from other regulated particles. In addition, we provide

              Variants of this question have preoccupied researchers in a wide
              range of domains, from mainstream experimental psychology
              (cognition, perception, social behavior) to cognitive
              neuroscience and behavioral economics. A pervasive view places a
              heavy explanatory burden on an intelligent cognitive unconscious,
              with many theories assigning causally effective roles to
              unconscious influences. This article presents a novel framework
              for evaluating these claims and reviews evidence from three major
              bodies of research in which unconscious factors have been
              studied: multiple-cue judgment, deliberation without attention,
              and decisions under uncertainty. Studies of priming (subliminal
              and primes-to-behavior) and the role of awareness in movement and
              perception (e.g., timing of willed actions, blindsight) are also
              given brief consideration. The review highlights that inadequate
              procedures for assessing awareness, failures to consider
              artifactual explanations of ``landmark'' results, and a tendency
              to uncritically accept conclusions that fit with our intuitions
              have all contributed to unconscious influences being ascribed
              inflated and erroneous explanatory power in theories of decision
              making. The review concludes by recommending that future research
              should focus on tasks in which participants' attention is
              diverted away from the experimenter's hypothesis, rather than the
              highly reflective tasks that are currently often employed.",

              area (VTA) and substantia nigra (SN) is likely to be crucial for
              reward processing that guides learning. One of the key structures
              implicated in the regulation of this DA burst firing is the
              pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPTg), which projects to both
              the VTA and SN. Different literatures suggest that the PPTg
              serves as a sensory-gating area for DA cells or it regulates
              voluntary movement. This study recorded PPTg single-unit activity
              as rats perform a spatial navigation task to examine the
              potential for both reward and movement contributions. PPTg cells
              showed significant changes in firing relative to reward
              acquisition, the velocity of movement across the maze and turning
              behaviors of the rats. Reward, but not movement, correlates were
              impacted by changes in context, and neither correlate type was
              affected by reward manipulations (e.g. changing the expected
              location of a reward). This suggests that the PPTg conjunctively
              codes both reward and behavioral information, and that the reward
              information is processed in a context-dependent manner. The
              distinct anatomical distribution of reward and movement cells
              emphasizes different models of synaptic control by PPTg of DA
              burst firing in the VTA and SN. Relevant to both VTA and SN
              learning systems, however, PPTg appears to serve as a sensory
              gating mechanism to facilitate reinforcement learning, while at

  abstract = "Natural scenes typically contain multiple objects that are unique
              in different stimulus dimensions so that an object with feature
              contrast to surrounding objects draws attention and pops out.
              Furthermore, if we have previous knowledge about the dimension in
              which a target object differs from the surrounding objects, we
              will attend to that dimension and more easily detect the target.
              Our aims here were to elucidate neural mechanisms underlying this
              type of attention by recording neuronal activities from area V4
              and to investigate how visual signals encoding feature contrast
              between objects are modulated by attention specific to a
              particular dimension. To accomplish this, we trained monkeys to
              do a multidimensional visual search task in which two singleton
              stimuli, unique in the color or shape dimension, were presented
              with four other identical stimuli. The monkeys had to search for
              the singleton stimulus that was unique in the instructed
              dimension while the search dimension was switched between shape
              and color. We found that individual V4 neurons carry visual
              signals encoding feature contrast in either shape or color, and
              this signal is modulated depending on the search dimension.
              Population responses to the target singleton stimulus were
              significantly higher than to others, regardless of the search
              dimension. In most V4 neurons, however, significant response
              increases occurred only when one particular singleton stimulus
              was the target. These findings suggest that interaction between
              bottom-up signals encoding feature contrast between stimuli and
              top-down signals encoding search dimension occurs in V4 and
              facilitates adaptive selection of targets in a complex visual

              either dynamic Glass patterns (Glass, 1969) or coherent motion
              displays. SSVEPs were used to estimate neural activity in a set
              of fMRI-defined visual areas in each subject. To compare activity
              associated with local versus global processing, we analyzed two
              frequency components of the SSVEP in each visual area: the high
              temporal frequency at which the local dots were updated (30 Hz)
              and the much lower frequency corresponding to updates in the
              global structure (0.83 Hz). Local and global responses were

              tasks-subjects had to either direct their attention toward or
              away from the global coherence of the stimuli. The data show that

              the arrival or non-arrival of a food pellet at the beginning of
              each trial acted as an instruction cue, signalling which of two
              visually distinct stimulus objects the animal should choose on
              that trial in order to obtain a further food pellet reward.
              Following surgical removal of the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex
              in one hemisphere and the inferior temporal cortex in the
              contralateral hemisphere, combined with forebrain commissurotomy,
              the four operated animals were severely impaired at relearning
              this task. They were not impaired, however, in non-conditional
              visual discrimination learning. Extending the unilateral frontal
              lesion to include the ventromedial prefrontal cortex had no
              detrimental effect, nor did complete unilateral removal of the

               have clearly contributed to our understanding of the functional
               anatomy of the human brain, it is less clear that they have
               changed the way in which we think about the brain. The issue, in
               other words, is whether they have established new principles
               about how the brain works. In this paper we offer as an example
               one new principle, partly to lay down the criteria that are
               required for establishing a new principle, and partly to
               encourage others to offer other principles.Our example concerns
               the flexible flow of information through the cortex that must
               occur according to the demands of the task or current context.
               We suggest that this flexibility is achieved by feedback
               connections from the prefrontal and parietal cortex, and that
               these include connections to sensory and motor areas. However,
               the nature of the selective effect differs. The parietal cortex
               can select both within and across processing streams. By across
               streams we mean that it can have the same influence on different
               streams, for example the dorsal and ventral visual systems.
               However, only the prefrontal cortex can also select between
               processing streams. The difference between the prefrontal and
               parietal effects is due to their different positions within the
               processing hierarchy. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.",

  abstract = "Somatosensory and motor disturbances of hand function were
              examined in 9 patients with parietal lobe lesions. A quantitative
              score was used for the elaboration of sensorimotor profiles
              displaying the relative degree of functional impairment. In
              patients with anterior parietal lobe lesions somaesthesis was
              clearly more disturbed than motor function. Simple aspects of
              somaesthesis (surface sensibility, two-point discrimination,
              position sense) were disturbed to about the same degree as
              complex somatosensory (tactile recognition) tasks. On the other
              hand, patients with lesions of the posterior parietal lobe showed
              preferential impairment of complex somatosensory and motor
              functions (exploratory and manipulative finger movements). In 4
              patients, analysis of motor behaviour by means of an
              optoelectronic system showed that reaching, formation of hand
              aperture and target acquisition were less disturbed than
              manipulative behaviour. Finger movement trajectories during
              dynamic digital palpation of objects were grossly deranged in the
              patients with posterior parietal damage. The temporal
              characteristics of the finger movements during active touch were
              completely destroyed. This leads to a breakdown of the finely
              tuned digital scanning process required for the sequential
              sampling of mechanoreceptive information. Remarkably, these
              patients could produce the exploratory finger movements
              imitatively. The motor disability of the parietal hand does not
              lie in the loss of the kinetic memory to perform these movements,
              but in the loss of their evocation by appropriate sensory
              stimuli. This deficit is not due to a lack of somatosensory
              information because that may be relatively well preserved. It is
              concluded that the motor disturbance in posterior parietal lobe
              disease lies essentially in the conception and execution of the
              spatiotemporal movement patterns necessary to bring those
              receptors into action which would normally provide the
              information about tactile objects. This illustrates the intricate
              mutual dependence of the spatiotemporal organization of receptor
              activation by movement and of the formation of movement
              trajectories on the basis of adequate sensory processing.",

               order of movements while simultaneously optimizing sensorimotor
               parameters such as trajectory, timing, velocity and force.
               Neurophysiological studies in animals and humans have identified
               the major brain regions involved in sequence learning, including
               the motor cortex (M1), basal ganglia (BG) and cerebellum.
               Current models link these regions to different stages of
               learning (early vs. late) or different components of performance
               (spatial vs. sensorimotor). At the same time, research in motor
               control has given rise to the concept that internal models at
               different levels of the motor system may contribute to learning.
               The goal of this review is to develop a new framework for motor
               sequence learning that combines stage and component models
               within the context of internal models. To do this, we review
               behavioral and neuroimaging studies in humans and
               neurophysiological studies in animals. Based on this evidence,
               we present a model proposing that sequence learning is
               underwritten by parallel, interacting processes, including
               internal model formation and sequence representation, that are
               instantiated in specific cerebellar, BG or M1 mechanisms
               depending on task demands and the stage of learning. The
               striatal system learns predictive stimulus-response associations
               and is critical for motor chunking. The role of the cerebellum
               is to acquire the optimal internal model for sequence
               performance in a particular context, and to contribute to error
               correction and control of on-going movement. M1 acts to store
               the representation of a learned sequence, likely as part of a
               distributed network including the parietal lobe and premotor
               cortex. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.",

              investigating the responses of early visual areas to phase
              coherence have led to apparently discordant results. We studied
              the human brain BOLD responses to structured periodic band-pass
              images of matched amplitude spectrum but of different phase
              spectra, arranged to create three distinct types of stimuli: pure
              edges; pure lines (matched global and local energy to the edges,
              but different phase); and random noise (random phase spectrum,
              hence no salient features, and a different spatial distribution
              of local energy from the lines and edges stimuli). Alternation of
              lines against edges did not activate primary visual cortex, but
              did activate two higher order visual areas. Alternation of these
              lines or edges against the random stimulus produced a strong
              activity in many visual areas, including primary visual cortex.
              Interestingly, the BOLD activity was higher for the edges and
              lines than for the random stimuli for a wide range of stimulus
              contrasts, indicating the presence of non-linear gain modulation
              in the cell response. These results show that phase congruency is
              coded at the level of primary visual cortex. We show that a stage

              that depend on selective attention, which are an essential
              component of conscious awareness. Psychopharmacological and
              pathological evidence supports the concept of a 'cholinergic
              component' of conscious awareness. Drugs that antagonize
              muscarinic receptors induce hallucinations and reduce the level
              of consciousness, while the nicotinic receptor is implicated as
              being involved in the mechanism of action of general
              (inhalational) anaesthetics. In degenerative diseases of the
              brain, alterations in consciousness are associated with regional
              deficits in the cholinergic system. In Alzheimer's disease (AD),
              there is a loss of explicit (more than implicit) memory and
              hypoactivity of cholinergic projections to the hippocampus and
              cortex, while the visual hallucinations experienced by subjects

              reductions in neocortical ACh-related activity. In Parkinson's

              neurones, which control REM (rapid eye movement) sleep or

               which was guided by bottom-up saliency, the target grating was
               defined by color contrast; again both switch and non-switch
               trials occurred. We observed stronger evoked responses during
               the color-cue task relative to the pop-out task in the inferior
               parietal lobule (IPL), frontal eye field (FEF), middle frontal
               gyrus (MFG), and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The contrast of
               switch vs. non-switch trials revealed activations in regions
               that were engaged when there was a change in the identity of the
               target. Collectively, switch trials evoked stronger responses
               relative to non-switch trials in fronto-parietal regions that
               appeared to be left lateralized, including left intraparietal
               sulcus (IPS) and left MFG/IFG. Task by trial type interactions
               (switch > non-switch during color-cue relative to pop-out) were
               observed in several fronto-parietal regions, including IPS, FEF,
               MFG and IFG, in addition to regions in visual cortex. Our
               findings suggest that, within the fronto-parietal attentional
               network, the IPS and MFG/IFG appear to be most heavily involved
               in attentive cue updating. Furthermore, several visual regions
               engaged by oriented gratings were strongly affected by cue
               updating, raising the possibility that they were the recipient
               of top-down signals that were generated when cue information was
               updated. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.",

  abstract = "To isolate neural correlates of conscious perception (NCCs), a
              standard approach has been to contrast neural activity elicited
              by identical stimuli of which subjects are aware vs. unaware.
              Because conscious experience is private, determining whether a
              stimulus was consciously perceived requires subjective report:
              e.g., button-presses indicating detection, visibility ratings,
              verbal reports, etc. This reporting requirement introduces a
              methodological confound when attempting to isolate NCCs: The
              neural processes responsible for accessing and reporting one's
              percept are difficult to distinguish from those underlying the
              conscious percept itself. Here, we review recent attempts to
              circumvent this issue via a modified inattentional blindness
              paradigm (Pitts et al., 2012) and present new data from a
              backward masking experiment in which task-relevance and visual
              awareness were manipulated in a 2 $\times$ 2 crossed design. In
              agreement with our previous inattentional blindness results,
              stimuli that were consciously perceived yet not immediately
              accessed for report (aware, task-irrelevant condition) elicited a
              mid-latency posterior ERP negativity (~200-240 ms), while stimuli
              that were accessed for report (aware, task-relevant condition)
              elicited additional components including a robust P3b (~380-480
              ms) subsequent to the mid-latency negativity. Overall, these
              results suggest that some of the NCCs identified in previous
              studies may be more closely linked with accessing and maintaining
              perceptual information for reporting purposes than with encoding
              the conscious percept itself. An open question is whether the
              remaining NCC candidate (the ERP negativity at 200-240 ms)
              reflects visual awareness or object-based attention.",

              insights into the neural basis of directional interference have
              been revealed recently, little is known about the neural network
              associated with amplitude interference. We investigated whether
              amplitude versus directional interference activates differential
              networks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was
              applied while subjects performed cyclical, bimanual joystick
              movements with either the same vs. different amplitudes,
              directions, or both. The kinematic analysis confirmed that
              subjects experienced amplitude interference when they moved with
              different as compared to the same amplitude, and directional
              interference when they moved along different as compared to the
              same direction. On the brain level, amplitude and directional
              interference both resulted in activation of a bilateral superior
              parietal-premotor network, which is known to contribute to
              sensorimotor transformations during goal-directed movements.
              Interestingly, amplitude but not directional interference
              exclusively activated a bilateral network containing the
              dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and
              supramarginal gyrus, which was shown previously to contribute to
              executive functions. Even though the encoding of amplitude and
              directional information converged and activated the same neural
              substrate, our data thus show that additional and partly

              in the middle temporal visual area of the macaque cortex (MT, or
              V5). The present paper asks whether speed is coded in a way that
              is invariant to the shape of the moving stimulus, and if so, how.
              When tested with single sine-wave gratings of different spatial
              and temporal frequencies, MT neurons show a continuum in the
              degree to which preferred speed depends on spatial frequency.
              There is some dependence in 75\% of MT neurons, and the other
              25\% maintain speed tuning despite changes in spatial frequency.
              When tested with stimuli constructed by adding two superimposed
              sine-wave gratings, the preferred speed of MT neurons becomes
              less dependent on spatial frequency. Analysis of these responses
              reveals a speed-tuning nonlinearity that selectively enhances the
              responses of the neuron when multiple spatial frequencies are
              present and moving at the same speed. Consistent with the
              presence of the nonlinearity, MT neurons show speed tuning that
              is close to form-invariant when the moving stimuli comprise
              square-wave gratings, which contain multiple spatial frequencies
              moving at the same speed. We conclude that the neural circuitry
              in and before MT makes no explicit attempt to render MT neurons
              speed-tuned for sine-wave gratings, which do not occur in natural
              scenes. Instead, MT neurons derive form-invariant speed tuning in

               examined the evidence for overlap of selection and stopping
               using two approaches: a meta-analysis of existing studies of
               selection and stopping, and a novel within-subject fMRI study in

              These rhythms originate from a variety of different network
              mechanisms, which give rise to a wide-ranging spectrum of
              oscillation frequencies. In the last few years an increasing
              number of clinical research studies have explored transcranial
              alternating current stimulation (tACS) with weak current as a
              tool for affecting brain function. The premise of these
              interventions is that tACS will interact with ongoing brain
              oscillations. However, the exact mechanisms by which weak
              currents could affect neuronal oscillations at different
              frequency bands are not well known and this, in turn, limits the
              rational optimization of human experiments. Here we review the
              available in vitro and in vivo animal studies that attempt to
              provide mechanistic explanations. The findings can be summarized
              into a few generic principles, such as periodic modulation of
              excitability, shifts in spike timing, modulation of firing rate,
              and shifts in the balance of excitation and inhibition. These
              effects result from weak but simultaneous polarization of a large
              number of neurons. Whether this can lead to an entrainment or a
              modulation of brain oscillations, or whether AC currents have no
              effect at all, depends entirely on the specific dynamic that
              gives rise to the different brain rhythms, as discussed here for
              slow wave oscillations (∼1 Hz) and gamma oscillations (∼30 Hz).
              We conclude with suggestions for further experiments to
              investigate the role of AC stimulation for other physiologically

  abstract = "The biased-competition theory accounts for attentional effects at
              the single-neuron level: It predicts that the neuronal response
              to simultaneously-presented stimuli is a weighted average of the
              response to isolated stimuli, and that attention biases the
              weights in favor of the attended stimulus. Perception, however,
              relies not on single neurons but on larger neuronal populations.
              The responses of such populations are in part reflected in
              large-scale multivoxel fMRI activation patterns. Because the
              pooling of neuronal responses into blood-oxygen-level-dependent
              signals is nonlinear, fMRI effects of attention need not mirror
              those observed at the neuronal level. Thus, to bridge the gap
              between neuronal responses and human perception, it is
              fundamental to understand attentional influences in large-scale
              multivariate representations of simultaneously-presented objects.
              Here, we ask how responses to simultaneous stimuli are combined
              in multivoxel fMRI patterns, and how attention affects the paired
              response. Objects from four categories were presented singly, or
              in pairs such that each category was attended, unattended, or
              attention was divided between the two. In a multidimensional
              voxel space, the response to simultaneously-presented categories
              was well described as a weighted average. The weights were biased
              toward the preferred category in category-selective regions.
              Consistent with single-unit reports, attention shifted the
              weights by approximately 30\% in favor of the attended stimulus.

              on both within-day (online) and between-day (offline) effects and
              on the rate of forgetting during a 3-month follow-up (long-term
              retention). There was greater total (online plus offline) skill
              acquisition with anodal tDCS compared to sham, which was mediated
              through a selective enhancement of offline effects. Anodal tDCS
              did not change the rate of forgetting relative to sham across the
              3-month follow-up period, and consequently the skill measure
              remained greater with anodal tDCS at 3 months. This prolonged
              enhancement may hold promise for the rehabilitation of brain
              injury. Furthermore, these findings support the existence of a
              consolidation mechanism, susceptible to anodal tDCS, which
              contributes to offline effects but not to online effects or

  abstract = "Purpose of Review: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
              has shown preliminary success in improving motor performance and
              motor learning in healthy individuals, and restitution of motor
              deficits in stroke patients. This brief review highlights some
              recent work. Recent Findings: Within the past years, behavioural
              studies have confirmed and specified the timing and polarity
              specific effects of tDCS on motor skill learning and motor
              adaptation. There is strong evidence that timely co-application
              of (hand/arm) training and anodal tDCS to the contralateral M1
              can improve motor learning. Improvements in motor function as
              measured by clinical scores have been described for combined tDCS
              and training in stroke patients. For this purpose, electrode
              montages have been modified with respect to interhemispheric
              imbalance after brain injury. Cathodal tDCS applied to the
              unlesioned M1 or bihemispheric M1 stimulation appears to be well
              tolerated and useful to induce improvements in motor function.
              Mechanistic studies in humans and animals are discussed with
              regard to physiological motor learning. Summary: tDCS is well
              tolerated, easy to use and capable of inducing lasting
              improvements in motor function. This method holds promise for the
              rehabilitation of motor disabilities, although acute studies in
              patients with brain injury are so far lacking. \copyright{} 2011

  abstract = "Rules are widely used in everyday life to organize actions and
              thoughts in accordance with our internal goals. At the simplest
              level, single rules can be used to link individual sensory
              stimuli to their appropriate responses. However, most tasks are
              more complex and require the concurrent application of multiple
              rules. Experiments on humans and monkeys have shown the
              involvement of a frontoparietal network in rule representation.
              Yet, a fundamental issue still needs to be clarified: Is the
              neural representation of multiple rules compositional, that is,
              built on the neural representation of their simple constituent
              rules? Subjects were asked to remember and apply either simple or
              compound rules. Multivariate decoding analyses were applied to
              functional magnetic resonance imaging data. Both ventrolateral
              frontal and lateral parietal cortex were involved in compound
              representation. Most importantly, we were able to decode the
              compound rules by training classifiers only on the simple rules
              they were composed of. This shows that the code used to store
              rule information in prefrontal cortex is compositional.
              Compositional coding in rule representation suggests that it
              might be possible to decode other complex action plans by
              learning the neural patterns of the known composing elements.",

              on additional control effort being indicated by performance costs
              relative to repeating the same task. This switch cost can be
              reduced by advance task preparation. In the present experiment
              the nature of advance preparation was investigated by comparing a
              situation where an explicit task cue was presented 2000 ms in
              advance of the target stimulus (CTI-2000) with a situation where
              cue and target were presented in close succession (CTI-100). We
              mapped the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) activation
              correlates of switch-related control effort and advance task
              preparation to test alternative explanations why advance
              preparation is reducing switch costs. A previously reported
              control-related cortical network of frontal and parietal brain
              areas emerged that was more strongly activated for switching
              between tasks. However, this was true exclusively for CTI-100
              where no advance task preparation was possible. At CTI-2000 these
              same brain areas were equally engaged in both switch and repeat
              trials. For some of these areas, this common activation was
              time-locked to the presentation of both the cue as well as the
              target. Other areas were exclusively associated with target
              processing. The overall pattern of results suggests that advance
              task preparation is a common process of pre-activating
              (cue-locked activation) the currently relevant task set which
              does not face interference from a persisting N - 1 task set.
              During target processing the same brain areas are re-engaged
              (subsequent target-locked activation) to apply the pre-activated
              task set. Though being common to repeat and switch trials,
              advance preparation has a differential benefit for switch trials.
              This is because the instructed task set has time to settle into a
              stable state, thus becoming resistant against disruption from the
              previous task set, which is retrieved by the current target

              subsequent cued hand movements, as opposed to an orienting or eye
              movement. We refer to this process as motor attention to
              distinguish it from orienting attention. Nine subjects with
              lesions that included the left parietal cortex and nine subjects
              with lesions including the right parietal cortex were compared
              with control subjects on the task. The left hemisphere subjects
              showed the same ability as controls to engage attention to a
              movement when they were forewarned by a valid precue. The left

              disengage the focus of motor attention from one movement to

              existence of two distinct attentional systems allied to the

              analogous problems in disengaging from one orienting/movement

              regions including the medial wall of the primary sensorimotor
              cortex, consistent with expected somatotopy. Medial wall
              activation during passive movement vs. rest was less intense and
              localized to the same region. Frontal and association cortices
              were more active during preparation or anticipation periods than

              for upright and inverted faces presented with and without noise.
              Results show a smaller amplitude for inverted faces than upright
              faces when presented in noise, whereas the reverse is true
              without noise. In Experiment 2, we show that the amplitude

              noise levels. In Experiment 3, we vary contrast to see if this

              effects. Thus, across conditions, adding noise to full faces is a

              visuo-spatial attention can act in the absence of visual
              awareness. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to record
              cortical neural activity from hemianopic patient GY while he
              performed a peripheral orientation-discrimination task in the
              context of an attention-cueing paradigm. The luminance contrast
              of target stimuli was set at GY's threshold for reports of
              awareness (a feeling ``that something happened'' in his blind
              visual field). GY's accuracy was significantly greater than
              chance and comparable, with or without awareness. GY was
              significantly faster to respond correctly on valid-cue versus
              invalid-cue trials, even in the absence of awareness, confirming
              the action of visuo-spatial attention in the absence of
              awareness. Time-frequency analysis of spectral power in the gamma
              frequency range (30-90 Hz), averaged over left parieto-occipital
              sensors, revealed effects of cue-validity independent of reported
              awareness, and effects of awareness independent of cue-validity.
              GY's reports of awareness were not, however, independent of his
              pre-target attentional state (gamma-band response to the central
              cue), consistent with a one-way, but not a two-way, dissociation
              between attention and awareness. Our evidence suggests that the
              observed cue-validity effect is an awareness-independent
              involuntary re-orienting response, and that the neurodynamics
              underlying the exogenous capture of attention are similar with or
              without awareness. The finding of a significant
              awareness-independent effect in the area of 40 Hz implies that a
              stimulus-induced modulation of power in the canonical gamma band
              is not a sufficient condition for sensory awareness. \copyright{}

              pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA) with no site-specificity
              and in the SMA proper according to the somatotopic organization,
              and shortly thereafter in the lateral premotor cortex bilaterally
              with relatively clear somatotopy. About 400 ms before the
              movement onset, the steeper negative slope, called 'late BP' in
              this article (also referred to as NS???), occurs in the
              contralateral primary motor cortex (M1) and lateral premotor
              cortex with precise somatotopy. These two phases of BP are
              differentially influenced by various factors, especially by
              complexity of the movement which enhances only the late BP.

              pathophysiology of various movement disorders. Volitional motor
              inhibition or muscle relaxation is preceded by BP quite similar
              to that preceding voluntary muscle contraction. Since BP of
              typical waveforms and temporospatial pattern does not occur
              before organic involuntary movements, BP is used for detecting
              the participation of the 'voluntary motor system' in the
              generation of apparently involuntary movements in patients with

               performance on complex arithmetic tasks. TRNS of the bilateral
               dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), a key area in arithmetic
               [4, 5], was uniquely coupled with near-infrared spectroscopy
               (NIRS) to measure online hemodynamic responses within the
               prefrontal cortex. Five consecutive days of TRNS-accompanied
               cognitive training enhanced the speed of both calculation- and
               memory-recall-based arithmetic learning. These behavioral
               improvements were associated with defined hemodynamic responses
               consistent with more efficient neurovascular coupling within the
               left DLPFC. Testing 6 months after training revealed
               long-lasting behavioral and physiological modifications in the
               stimulated group relative to sham controls for trained and
               nontrained calculation material. These results demonstrate that,
               depending on the learning regime, TRNS can induce long-term

               significant implications for basic and translational

              61.5 years) and thirty-two younger (mean age 23.2 years)

              to moving dichoptic plaids--stimuli composed of two orthogonally

              either the adapted or the unadapted grating's motion direction or
              to both (neutral condition). We show that observers were better
              at detecting a speed change in the attended than the unattended

              each of these processes is used in different conditions.
              Participants viewed displays that contained single or paired
              objects and learned which displays were usually followed by the
              appearance of a dot. Some participants predicted whether the dot

              appear were necessary in order for contingencies associated with
              one object to influence participants' predictions about the

              stimuli as we attend to them, and we attend to stimuli as we
              become aware of them. Recent evidence suggests that attention can
              also modulate the effects of stimuli that remain invisible, and a
              natural explanation is that attention enhances weak perceptual
              representations, bringing them closer to conscious threshold even
              if they do not reach that threshold. However, there is also the
              possibility that attention may modulate neural processes that are
              entirely separate from those supporting conscious perception:
              sensorimotor mechanisms that do not create awareness however much
              they are enhanced. Here we provide evidence in support of this
              second hypothesis by showing that attentional cueing can modulate
              the behavioral response to invisible stimuli in a way that is
              distinct from enhancing their visibility. We used a masked-prime
              paradigm that produces a negative or positive compatibility
              effect depending on the perceptual strength (duration or
              brightness) of the prime. We found that attention enhanced the
              effect of both visible and invisible primes and also increased
              the likelihood of detecting the prime (i.e., boosted perceptual
              strength). Crucially, the pattern of attentional influence on
              priming could not be explained by attentional modulation of the
              prime's perceptual strength but was predicted by a direct
              attentional influence on the nonconscious priming process itself.
              Therefore, in addition to regulating what we perceive, attention
              seems to influence our behavior through sensorimotor processes
              that are not involved in conscious awareness.",

              that such a movement can be triggered in response to a stimulus
              that is not perceived (that is, a stimulus of which the subject
              is unaware). In the present study, visual stimuli were presented
              at random in one of two different locations to normal human
              subjects in a choice reaction-time (RT) task. When the stimulus
              appeared in one of the locations, subjects made a motor response.
              When the stimulus appeared in the other location, subjects made a
              different motor response. Large and small stimuli were presented
              in either location. In some trials, the small stimulus was
              followed 50 ms later by the large stimulus. The small stimulus
              was then ``masked'' by the large stimulus and could not be

               resort to strategic counterprediction rather than to stochastic
               choice. Here, we show that rats also use history- and

               can switch to a ``stochastic'' mode when challenged with a

  abstract = "Intentions, including their temporal properties and semantic
              content, are receiving increased attention, and neuroscientific
              studies in humans vary with respect to the topography of
              intention-related neural responses. This may reflect the fact
              that the kind of intentions investigated in one study may not be
              exactly the same kind investigated in the other. Fine-grained
              intention taxonomies developed in the philosophy of mind may be
              useful to identify the neural correlates of well-defined types of
              intentions, as well as to disentangle them from other related
              mental states, such as mere urges to perform an action.
              Intention-related neural signals may be exploited by
              brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that are currently being
              developed to restore speech and motor control in paralyzed
              patients. Such BMI devices record the brain activity of the
              agent, interpret (``decode'') the agent's intended action, and
              send the corresponding execution command to an artificial
              effector system, e.g., a computer cursor or a robotic arm. In the
              present paper, we evaluate the potential of intention concepts
              from philosophy of mind to improve the performance and safety of
              BMIs based on higher-order, intention-related control signals. To
              this end, we address the distinction between future-,
              present-directed, and motor intentions, as well as the
              organization of intentions in time, specifically to what extent
              it is sequential or hierarchical. This has consequences as to
              whether these different types of intentions can be expected to
              occur simultaneously or not. We further illustrate how it may be
              useful or even necessary to distinguish types of intentions
              exposited in philosophy, including yes- vs. no-intentions and
              oblique vs. direct intentions, to accurately decode the agent's
              intentions from neural signals in practical BMI applications.",

  abstract = "The way in which input noise perturbs the behavior of a system
              depends on the internal processing structure of the system. In
              visual psychophysics, there is a long tradition of using external
              noise methods (i.e., adding noise to visual stimuli) as tools for
              system identification. Here, we demonstrate that external noise
              affects processing of visual scenes at different cortical areas
              along the human ventral visual pathway, from retinotopic regions
              to higher occipitotemporal areas implicated in visual shape
              processing. We found that when the contrast of the stimulus was
              held constant, the further away from the retinal input a cortical
              area was the more its activity, as measured with functional
              magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), depended on the
              signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the visual stimulus. A similar
              pattern of results was observed when trials with correct and
              incorrect responses were analyzed separately. We interpret these
              findings by extending signal detection theory to fMRI data
              analysis. This approach reveals the sequential ordering of
              decision stages in the cortex by exploiting the relation between
              fMRI response and stimulus SNR. In particular, our findings
              provide novel evidence that occipitotemporal areas in the ventral
              visual pathway form a cascade of decision stages with increasing
              degree of signal uncertainty and feature invariance.",

              second case its colour allows a decision between alternative
              courses of action. This study contrasts these two categories of
              visuomotor transformation. Our goal was to test the hypothesis
              that visual information can influence the motor system through
              different, task-dependent pathways. We used positron emission
              tomography (PET) to measure human brain activity during the
              performance of two tasks requiring the transformation of visual
              stimuli to motor responses. The stimuli instructed either a
              spatially congruent grasping movement or an arbitrarily
              associated hand movement. The experimental design emphasised
              preparatory- over movement-related activity. We expected ventral
              parieto-precentral regions to contribute to the visuomotor
              transformations underlying grasping movements, and
              fronto-striatal circuitry to contribute to the selection of
              actions on the basis of associative rules. We found that
              selecting between alternative courses of action on the basis of
              associative rules specifically involved ventral prefrontal,
              striatal and dorsal precentral areas. Conversely, spatially
              congruent grasping movements evoked specific differential
              responses in ventral precentral and parietal regions. The results
              suggest that visual information can flow through the dorsal
              system to determine how actions are performed, but that
              fronto-striatal loops are involved in specifying which action
              should be performed in the current context.",

               constitute evidence that voluntary movements are initiated

               on the assumption that the electrophysiological signs recorded
               by Libet, Gleason, Wright, and Pearl (1983) are associated only
               with preparation for movement. We tested that assumption by
               comparing the electrophysiological signs before a decision to
               move with signs present before a decision not to move. There was
               no evidence of stronger electrophysiological signs before a
               decision to move than before a decision not to move, so these
               signs clearly are not specific to movement preparation. We

              of objects is reflected by the activation in the lateral
              occipital cortex as well as in the frontal and parietal cortex.
              However, most previous studies used behavioral paradigms in which
              attention raised or enhanced visual consciousness (visibility or
              recognition performance). This co-occurrence made it difficult to
              reveal whether an observed cortical activation is related to
              visual consciousness or attention. The present fMRI study
              investigated the dissociability of neural activations underlying
              these two cognitive phenomena. Toward this aim, we used a visual
              backward masking paradigm in which directing attention could
              either enhance or reduce the object visibility. The participants'
              task was to report the level of subjective visibility for a
              briefly presented target object. The target was presented in the
              center with four flankers, which was followed by the same number
              of masks. Behavioral results showed that attention to the
              flankers enhanced the target visibility, whereas attention to the
              masks attenuated it. The fMRI results showed that the
              occipito-temporal sulcus increased activation in the attend
              flankers condition compared with the attend masks condition, and
              occipito-temporal sulcus activation levels positively correlated
              with the target visibility in both attentional conditions. On the
              other hand, the inferior frontal gyrus and the intraparietal
              sulcus increased activation in both the attend flankers and
              attend masks compared with an attend neither condition, and these
              activation levels were independent of target visibility. Taken

              positive emotional state defined in terms of a high arousal state
              such as excitement and a sense of personal achievement. Moreover,
              individual happiness is best predicted by personal goal
              attainment and high self-esteem or self-efficacy. In contrast, in
              East Asian cultural contexts (i.e., those found in Japan),
              happiness is construed as including experience of both positive
              and negative emotional state. Happiness is defined in terms of
              experiencing a low arousal state such as calmness and

              happiness is best predicted by relationship harmony and emotional

              on TeX, originated by Donald E. Knuth [8]. This a typesetting
              program, not a word processor. You enter some editor that saves
              plain text files. Then, you type text freely until you need
              something special, such as italic font or a complex mathematical
              expression. It was the desire to have high quality, low cost
              publications in mathematics and related disciplines that caused
              Knuth (pronounced Kah-nooth) to invent TeX (pronounced Tek) in
              the late 1970's. Originally believing that he could write a
              program in less than a year that could typeset documents, he
              actually ended up defining an entire branch of research in
              computer science. It was 10 years later that he published his
              seminal book [8], but he published articles along the way, and he
              permanently changed the way mathematical documents are prepared.
              LaTeX (pronounced Lah-tek or Lay-tek) is a collection of macros
              built on top of TeX that ``represents a balance between
              functionnality and ease of use'' [9, p. xiii]. LaTeX2$\epsilon$
              is the current version, developed by a team of volunteers:
              Johannes L. Braams, David P. Carlisle, Alan Jeffrey, Frank
              MittelBach, Chris Rowley, and Rainer Sch\{{\"o}\}pf [2]. A
              comprehensive coverage of LaTeX and the many enhancements to it
              is given by the ``The LaTeX companion'' [5]. By contrast, this
              book is designed to be a succinct introduction, omitting many of
              the things LaTeX2$\epsilon$ can do. My goal is to offer enough of
              an introduction that someone not acquainted with computers,
              particularly unix, the basics that are covered should take less
              than 10 hours, and one could do all of the exercises. For one who
              is just learning how to use a computer, it will take longer,
              especially getting use to functioning at the command line. In any
              case, the finer points require more study.",

              psychophysical and neurophysiological evidence for a dissociation
              between top-down attention and consciousness. The evidence
              includes recent findings that show subjects can attend to

              that subjects can become conscious of an isolated object, or the
              gist of the scene in the near absence of top-down attention; we
              critically re-examine the possibility of ``complete'' absence of
              top-down attention. We also cover the recent flurry of studies
              that utilized independent manipulation of attention and

              attention, including examples where top-down attention and

              selective attention and consciousness in dissociative paradigms.
              These findings point to a functional dissociation: attention as

  abstract = "The ability to predict action content from neural signals in real
              time before the action occurs has been long sought in the
              neuroscientific study of decision-making, agency and volition.
              On-line real-time (ORT) prediction is important for understanding
              the relation between neural correlates of decision-making and
              conscious, voluntary action as well as for brain-machine
              interfaces. Here, epilepsy patients, implantded with intracranial
              depth microelectodes or subdural grid electrodes for clinical
              purposes, participated in a ``matching-pennies'' game against an
              opponent. In each trial, subjects were given a 5 s countdown,
              after which they had to raise their left or right hand
              immediately as the ``go'' signal appeared on a computer screen.
              They won a fixed amount of money if they raised a different hand
              than their opponent and lost that amount otherwise. The question
              we here studied was the extent to which neural precursors of the
              subjects' decisions can be detected in intracranial local field
              potentials (LFP) prior to the onset of the action. We found that
              combinded low-frequency (0.1-5 Hz) LFP signals from 10 electrodes
              were predictive of the intended left-/right-hand movements before
              the onset of the go signal. Our ORT system predicted which hand
              the patient would raise 0.5 s before the go signal with 68\%
              accuracy in two patients. Based on these results, we constructed
              an ORT system that tracked up to 30 electrodes simultaneously,
              and tested it on retrospective data from 7 patients. On average,
              we could predict the correct hand choice in 83\% of the trials,
              which rose to 92\% if we let the system drop 3/10 of the trials
              on which it was less confident. Out system demonstrates-for the
              first time-the feasibility of accurately predicting a binary
              action on single trials in real time for patients with
              intracranial recordings, well before the action occurs.",

              Python. Existing solutions have mostly been implemented in C++,

              non-computer-scientists, or in Matlab, which is not well suited
              for more advanced visual or auditory applications. Pyff was
              designed to make experimental paradigms (i.e., feedback and
              stimulus applications) easily programmable. It includes base
              classes for various types of common feedbacks and stimuli as well
              as useful libraries for external hardware such as eyetrackers.
              Pyff is also equipped with a steadily growing set of ready-to-use
              feedbacks and stimuli. It can be used as a standalone
              application, for instance providing stimulus presentation in
              psychophysics experiments, or within a closed loop such as in
              biofeedback or brain--computer interfacing experiments. Pyff
              communicates with other systems via a standardized communication
              protocol and is therefore suitable to be used with any system
              that may be adapted to send its data in the specified format.
              Having such a general, open-source framework will help foster a

              groups. In particular, it will decrease the need of reprogramming

              approach that increases the accuracy of current delivery to the
              brain by using arrays of smaller ``high-definition'' electrodes,
              instead of the larger pad-electrodes of conventional tDCS.
              Targeting is achieved by energizing electrodes placed in
              predetermined configurations. One of these is the 4x1-ring
              configuration. In this approach, a center ring electrode (anode
              or cathode) overlying the target cortical region is surrounded by
              four return electrodes, which help circumscribe the area of
              stimulation. Delivery of 4x1-ring HD-tDCS is capable of inducing
              significant neurophysiological and clinical effects in both
              healthy subjects and patients. Furthermore, its tolerability is
              supported by studies using intensities as high as 2.0
              milliamperes for up to twenty minutes. Even though 4x1 HD-tDCS is
              simple to perform, correct electrode positioning is important in
              order to accurately stimulate target cortical regions and exert
              its neuromodulatory effects. The use of electrodes and hardware
              that have specifically been tested for HD-tDCS is critical for
              safety and tolerability. Given that most published studies on 4x1
              HD-tDCS have targeted the primary motor cortex (M1), particularly
              for pain-related outcomes, the purpose of this article is to
              systematically describe its use for M1 stimulation, as well as
              the considerations to be taken for safe and effective
              stimulation. However, the methods outlined here can be adapted

  abstract = "It has been repeatedly proposed to expand the scope for SETI, and
              one of the suggested alternatives to radio is the biological
              media. Genomic DNA is already used on Earth to store
              non-biological information. Though smaller in capacity, but
              stronger in noise immunity is the genetic code. The code is a
              flexible mapping between codons and amino acids, and this
              flexibility allows modifying the code artificially. But once
              fixed, the code might stay unchanged over cosmological
              timescales; in fact, it is the most durable construct known.
              Therefore it represents an exceptionally reliable storage for an
              intelligent signature, if that conforms to biological and
              thermodynamic requirements. As the actual scenario for the origin
              of terrestrial life is far from being settled, the proposal that
              it might have been seeded intentionally cannot be ruled out. A
              statistically strong intelligent-like `` signal'' in the genetic
              code is then a testable consequence of such scenario. Here we
              show that the terrestrial code displays a thorough precision-type
              orderliness matching the criteria to be considered an
              informational signal. Simple arrangements of the code reveal an
              ensemble of arithmetical and ideographical patterns of the same
              symbolic language. Accurate and systematic, these underlying
              patterns appear as a product of precision logic and nontrivial
              computing rather than of stochastic processes (the null
              hypothesis that they are due to chance coupled with presumable
              evolutionary pathways is rejected with P-value<10-13). The
              patterns are profound to the extent that the code mapping itself
              is uniquely deduced from their algebraic representation. The
              signal displays readily recognizable hallmarks of artificiality,
              among which are the symbol of zero, the privileged decimal syntax
              and semantical symmetries. Besides, extraction of the signal
              involves logically straightforward but abstract operations,
              making the patterns essentially irreducible to any natural
              origin. Plausible ways of embedding the signal into the code and
              possible interpretation of its content are discussed. Overall,
              while the code is nearly optimized biologically, its limited
              capacity is used extremely efficiently to pass non-biological
              information. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc..",

               cortical excitability and thereby influencing motor behaviour
               and learning. Hypothesis: While there is increasing knowledge
               about the importance of the primary motor cortex (M1) in short-
               and long-term motor skill learning, little is known about the
               role of secondary motor areas such as the supplementary and
               pre-supplementary motor area (SMA/pre-SMA) especially in
               short-term motor performance. Since SMA but not pre-SMA is
               directly connected to M1, we hypothesize that anodal tDCS over
               SMA but not pre-SMA will facilitate visuomotor learning.
               Methods: We applied anodal tDCS (tDCSanodal) over left SMA,
               pre-SMA or M1 (n = 12 in each group) while subjects performed a
               visuomotor pinch force task (VPFT) with their right hand and
               compared VPFT performance relative to sham (tDCSsham). Results:
               For the first time, we could show that apart from tDCSanodal
               over left M1 also SMA but not pre-SMA stimulation promotes
               short-term improvements in visuomotor learning relative to
               tDCSsham. Conclusions: Our findings provide novel evidence about
               the role of SMA in short-term visuomotor performance. This
               knowledge might be beneficial in developing hypothesis-driven

              investigating the human brain. However, fMRI data present some
              complications for statistical analysis and modeling. One recently
              developed approach to these data focuses on estimation of
              computational encoding models that describe how stimuli are
              transformed into brain activity measured in individual voxels.
              Here we aim at building encoding models for fMRI signals recorded
              in the primary visual cortex of the human brain. We use residual
              analyses to reveal systematic nonlinearity across voxels not
              taken into account by previous models. We then show how a sparse
              nonparametric method [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 71 (2009b)
              1009-1030] can be used together with correlation screening to
              estimate nonlinear encoding models effectively. Our approach
              produces encoding models that predict about 25\% more accurately
              than models estimated using other methods [Nature 452 (2008a)
              352--355]. The estimated nonlinearity impacts the inferred
              properties of individual voxels, and it has a plausible
              biological interpretation. One benefit of quantitative encoding
              models is that estimated models can be used to decode brain
              activity, in order to identify which specific image was seen by
              an observer. Encoding models estimated by our approach also

              awareness and top-down attention are two distinct processes, it
              is not clear how they are neurally dissociated in the visual
              system. Using a two-by-two factorial functional magnetic
              resonance imaging design with binocular suppression, we found
              that the visibility or invisibility of a visual target led to
              only nonsignificant blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD)
              effects in the human primary visual cortex (V1). Directing
              attention toward and away from the target had much larger and
              robust effects across all study participants. The difference in
              the lower-level limit of BOLD activation between attention and
              awareness illustrates dissociated neural correlates of the two
              processes. Our results agree with previously reported V1 BOLD

              inattentional blindness (IB), in which a surprisingly salient
              event right in front of you may go completely unseen when
              unattended. Does IB reflect a failure of perception, or only of
              subsequent memory? Previous work has been unable to answer this
              question, due to a seemingly intractable dilemma: ruling out
              memory requires immediate perceptual reports, but soliciting such
              reports fuels an expectation that eliminates IB. Here we
              introduce a way of evoking repeated IB in the same subjects and
              the same session: we show that observers fail to report seeing
              salient events' not only when they have no expectation, but also
              when they have the wrong expectations about the events nature.
              This occurs when observers must immediately report seeing
              anything unexpected, even mid-event. Repeated IB thus
              demonstrates that IB is aptly named: it reflects a genuine

              form of inattentional amnesia.",

              things. This feeling occurs for many things we do, conveying to
              us again and again the sense that we consciously cause our
              actions. But the feeling may not be a true reading of what is
              happening in our minds, brains, and bodies as our actions are
              produced. The feeling of conscious will can be fooled. This
              happens in clinical disorders such as alien hand syndrome,
              dissociative identity disorder, and schizophrenic auditory
              hallucinations. And in people without disorders, phenomena such
              as hypnosis, automatic writing, Ouija board spelling, water
              dowsing, facilitated communication, speaking in tongues, spirit
              possession, and trance channeling also illustrate anomalies of
              will--cases when actions occur without will or will occurs
              without action. This book brings these cases together with
              research evidence from laboratories in psychology to explore a
              theory of apparent mental causation. According to this theory,
              when a thought appears in consciousness just prior to an action,
              is consistent with the action, and appears exclusive of salient
              alternative causes of the action, we experience conscious will
              and ascribe authorship to ourselves for the action. Experiences
              of conscious will thus arise from processes whereby the mind
              interprets itself--not from processes whereby mind creates
              action. Conscious will, in this view, is an indication that we

               processing, and this ability is critical for maintaining items
               in working memory in the presence of distraction. Prior research
               demonstrates that children are less capable of focusing
               attention, relative to adults, and that this ability develops
               significantly during middle childhood. Here, using fMRI and a
               face/scene working memory task adapted from Gazzaley et al.
               (2005a,b), we compared top-down modulation in 15 children (aged
               8-13) and 15 young adults (aged 19-26). Replicating prior

              experimental stimulus. Even if a model is successfully fit to the
              data and its goodness of fit is acceptable, experimenters require
              an estimate of the variability of the parameters to assess
              whether differences across conditions are significant. Accurate
              estimates of variability are difficult to obtain, how-ever, given
              the typically small size of psychophysical data sets: Traditional
              statistical techniques are only asymptotically correct and can be
              shown to be unreliable in some common situations. Here and in our
              companion paper (Wichmann \& Hill, 2001), we suggest alternative
              statistical techniques based on Monte Carlo resampling methods.
              The present paper' s principal topic is the estimation of the
              variability of fitted parameters and derived quantities, such as
              thresholds and slopes. First, we outline the basic bootstrap
              procedure and argue in favor of the parametric, as opposed to the
              nonparametric, bootstrap. Second, we describe how the bootstrap
              bridging assumption, on which the validity of the procedure
              depends, can be tested. Third, we show how one' s choice of
              sampling scheme (the placement of sample points on the stimulus
              axis) strongly affects the reliability of bootstrap confidence
              intervals, and we make recom-mendations on how to sample the
              psychometric function efficiently. Fourth, we show that, under
              cer-tain circumstances, the (arbitrary) choice of the
              distribution function can exert an unwanted influence on the size
              of the bootstrap confidence intervals obtained, and we make
              recommendations on how to avoid this influence. Finally, we
              introduce improved confidence intervals (bias corrected and
              accelerated) that improve on the parametric and percentile-based
              bootstrap confidence intervals previously used. Software

              explore this hypothesis, we employed a functional magnetic
              resonance imaging (fMRI) protocol previously used to identify the
              neural substrate of imitation, and human MN function, to compare
              16 adolescent males of normal intelligence with autistic spectrum
              disorder (ASD) and age, sex and IQ matched controls. In the
              control group, in accord with previous findings, we identified
              activity attributable to MNs in areas of the right parietal lobe.
              Activity in this area was less extensive in the ASD group and was
              absent during non-imitative action execution. Broca's area was
              minimally active during imitation in controls. Differential
              patterns of activity during imitation and action observation in
              ASD and controls were most evident in an area at the right
              temporo-parietal junction also associated with a 'theory of mind'

  abstract = "The cognitive signature of unconscious processes is hotly debated
              recently. Generally, consciousness is thought to mediate
              flexible, adaptive and goal-directed behavior, but in the last
              decade unconscious processing has rapidly gained ground on
              traditional conscious territory. In this study we demonstrate
              that the scope and impact of unconscious information on behavior
              and brain activity can be modulated dynamically on a
              trial-by-trial basis. Participants performed a Go/No-Go
              experiment in which an unconscious (masked) stimulus preceding a
              conscious target could be associated with either a Go or No-Go
              response. Importantly, the mapping of stimuli onto these actions
              varied on a trial-by-trial basis, preventing the formation of
              stable associations and hence the possibility that unconscious
              stimuli automatically activate these control actions. By
              eliminating stimulus-response associations established through
              practice we demonstrate that unconscious information can be
              processed in a flexible and adaptive manner. In this experiment
              we show that the same unconscious stimulus can have a
              substantially different effect on behavior and (prefrontal) brain
              activity depending on the rapidly changing task context in which
              it is presented. This work suggests that unconscious information
              processing shares many sophisticated characteristics (including
              flexibility and context-specificity) with its conscious
              counterpart.",

              attention degrades the precision of sensory signals, precludes
              their conversion into decision signals, or dampens the
              integration of decision information toward an appropriate

              the behavioral level. However, the amount of overlap between
              their neural correlates remains a matter of debate. We recorded
              magnetoencephalographic signals while human subjects attended
              toward or away from faint stimuli that were reported as
              consciously seen only half of the time. Visually identical
              stimuli could thus be attended or not and consciously seen or
              not. Although attended stimuli were consciously seen slightly
              more often than unattended ones, the factorial analysis of
              stimulus-induced oscillatory brain activity revealed distinct and
              independent neural correlates of visual awareness and spatial
              attention at different frequencies in the gamma range (30-150

              responses to visual and auditory targets. The responses are
              modulated by eye position and head position. These findings
              suggest that PPC integrates multisensory inputs and may provide
              information about saccadic targets represented in different
              coordinate frames. In addition to an eyecentered output
              representation, PPC may also project to brain areas which contain
              head-centered and body-centered representations of the space. In
              this report, possible coordinate transformations in PPC were
              examined by comparing several sets of models of PPC, each having
              different representations in the output layer: (i) an
              eye-centered map only; (ii) a head-centered map only; (iii) an
              eye-centered map and a head-centered map; and (iv) an
              eye-centered map, a head-centered map, and a body-centered map.
              These output maps correctly encoded saccades to visual and
              auditory targets through training. The units in the hidden layers
              of the models exhibited the following properties: (1) The units
              had gain fields (GFs) for eye position, and also for head
              position if the model had a body-centered output representation;
              (2) As the result of the GF and the nonlinear activation function
              of the units, the hidden layers often employed ``intermediate''
              coding, e.g., the hidden units coded targets partially in
              eye-centered coordinates and, partially, in head-centered
              coordinates; (3) Different types of coordinate transformations in
              these models were carried out by different relationships between
              the receptive fields (RFs) and the GFs of the hidden units; and
              (4) The properties of PPC neurons are in better accordance with
              the hidden units of the models that had multiple-output
              representations than the models that had only one single-output
              representation. In conclusion, the results show that the GF is an
              effective mechanism for performing coordinate transformations.
              The models also suggest that neurons with intermediate coding are
              to be expected in the process of coordinate transformations.",

              two different categories of information are processed by PM
              neurons. Monkeys performed a delayed reaching task after
              receiving two different sets of visual instructions, one directly
              specifying the spatial location of a motor target (a direct
              spatial-target cue) and the other providing abstract information
              about the spatial location of a motor target by indicating
              whether to select the right or left target at a conceptual level
              (a symbolic action-selection cue). By comparing visual responses
              of PM neurons to the two sets of visual cues, we found that the
              conceptual action plan indicated by the symbolic action-selection
              cue was represented predominantly in dorsal PM (PMd) neurons with
              a longer latency (150 ms), whereas both PMd and ventral PM (PMv)
              neurons responded with a shorter latency (90 ms) when the motor
              target was directly specified with the direct spatial-target cue.
              We also found that excited, but not inhibited, responses of PM
              neurons to the direct spatial-target cue were biased toward

              guided motor act; one circuit, linked more strongly with PMd,
              carries information for retrieving action instruction associated
              with a symbolic cue, and the other circuit, linked with PMd and
              PMv, carries information for directly specifying a visuospatial

              ventral cortical area. Using high-throughput computational

              yield a coherent motion percept as it is involved in a variety of
              visual tasks. This combination necessarily means to trade-off
              between loosing spatio-temporal resolution by pooling local
              signals and maintaining perceptually significant segmentation
              between them. When signals are pooled to detect the presence of
              coherent motion in large amounts of random noise, the question
              raised is how the noise affects the perceived quality, in
              particular speed, of the coherent motion. Is there an analogy to
              the well-known reduction in the perceived speed of moving
              gratings at low contrast? Using a two-interval forced-choice
              procedure, we have investigated the assessment of speed in
              random-dot kinematograms containing different proportions of
              noise. Under the conditions investigated, there is no strong
              reduction of perceived speed with increasing noise, as long as
              coherence levels remain well above the thresholds for directional
              judgements. This basic result, which could suggest considerable
              but not perfect segregation of signal and noise motion components
              in the pooling process leading to speed estimation, is discussed
              in relation to a model that is designed to decode speed from a
              population of elementary motion detectors (EMDs) of the
              correlation type. A strategy to estimate speed from a set of EMDs
              with a variety of spatio-temporal tuning does not only provide a

              To solve these problems, neural and behavioral measures should be

  abstract = "What are the neural correlates of conscious visual awareness?
              Tackling this question requires contrasting neural correlates of
              stimulus processing culminating in visual awareness with neural
              correlates of stimulus processing unaccompanied by awareness. To
              produce these two neural states, one must be able to erase an
              otherwise visible stimulus from awareness. This article describes
              and assesses visual phenomena involving dissociation of physical
              stimulation and conscious awareness: degraded stimulation, visual
              masking, visual crowding, bistable figures, binocular rivalry,
              motion-induced blindness, inattentional blindness, change
              blindness and attentional blink. No single approach stands above
              the others, but those producing changing visual awareness despite
              invariant physical stimulation are clearly preferable. Such
              phenomena can help lead us ultimately to a comprehensive account
              of the neural correlates of conscious awareness. \copyright{}

              consciousness have traditionally assigned a crucial role to the
              prefrontal cortex in generating consciousness as well as in
              orchestrating high-level conscious control over behavior.
              However, recent neuroscientific findings show that prefrontal
              cortex can be activated unconsciously. The depth, direction, and
              scope of these activations depend on several top-down factors
              such as the task being probed (task-set, strategy) and on
              (temporal/spatial) attention. Regardless, such activations-when
              mediated by feedforward activation only-do not lead to a
              conscious sensation. Although unconscious, these prefrontal
              activations are functional, in the sense that they are associated
              with behavioral effects of cognitive control, such as response
              inhibition, task switching, conflict monitoring, and error
              detection. These findings challenge the pivotal role of the
              prefrontal cortex in consciousness. Instead, it appears that
              specific brain areas (or cognitive modules) may support specific
              cognitive functions but that consciousness is independent of
              this. Conscious sensations arise only when the brain areas
              involved engage in recurrent interactions enabling the
              long-lasting exchange of information between brain regions.
              Moreover, recent evidence suggests that also the state of
              consciousness, for example, in vegetative state patients or
              during sleep and anesthesia, is closely related to the scope and

               load in a delayed match-to-sample saccade task with a constant
               perceptual load. Two conditions were compared with low and high
               memory loads. In the low-load condition, a rectangular shaped
               probe defined by its color and orientation was presented
               centrally. After a delay period, four stimuli were presented
               peripherally, one in each quadrant. The participants were
               instructed to saccade to the stimulus that matched the
               previously viewed sample on both color and orientation. In the
               high-load condition, the order of stimulus presentation was
               reversed: first four eccentric stimuli were presented and after
               a delay the central probe. In the high-load condition, the
               participant executed a saccade to the remembered location of the
               stimulus that matched the central probe in color and
               orientation. The behavioral results indicate that greater
               working memory load is associated with prolonged saccadic
               reaction times. A general linear model revealed regions in
               prefrontal cortex (left anterior insula, right superior and
               middle frontal gyrus, anterior medial cingulum), and bilaterally

              unknown, thus suggesting a possible disconnect of the well
              established link between motion perception and cortical

              success or failure of past choices even in a standard
              two-alternative detection task, where choice history is
              irrelevant. The typical bias was one that made the subject switch

              poorer performance and were similar for observers in different

  abstract = "We investigated the effects of paired presentations of visual
              stimuli upon the evoked hemodynamic response of visual cortex
              measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Stimuli were
              identical 500-ms high-contrast checkerboard patterns, presented
              singly or with an interpair interval (IPI) of 1, 2, 4, or 6 s
              (onset-to-onset), followed by an intertrial interval of 16-20 s.
              Images were acquired at 1.5 Tesla using a gradient-echo
              echoplanar imaging sequence sensitive to blood-oxygenation-level
              dependent (BOLD) contrast. Single checkerboards evoked a
              hemodynamic response from visual cortex characterized by a rise
              at 3 s, peak activation at 5 s, and return to baseline by 10 s.
              We subtracted subjects' single-stimulus hemodynamic response from
              their paired-stimulus responses to isolate the contribution of
              the second stimulus. If the hemodynamic responses were fully
              additive, the residual should be a time-shifted replica of the
              single stimulus response. However, the amplitude of the
              hemodynamic response to the second checkerboard was smaller, and
              the peak latency was longer, than for the first. Furthermore, the
              amplitude decrement was dependent upon IPI, such that the
              response to the second stimulus at 1 s IPI was only 55\% of that
              to a single stimulus, with recovery to 90\% at a 6 s IPI. Peak
              latency was similarly dependent upon IPI with longer latencies
              observed for shorter IPIs. These results demonstrate an extended
              refractory period in the hemodynamic response to visual stimuli

              oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast has progressed
              rapidly and is commonly used to study function in many regions of
              the human brain. This paper introduces a method for
              characterizing the linear or nonlinear properties of the
              hemodynamic response. Such characterization is essential for
              accurate prediction of time-course behavior. Linearity of the
              BOLD response was examined in the primary visual cortex for
              manipulations of the stimulus amplitude and duration. Stimuli of
              1, 2, 4, and 8 s duration (80\% contrast) and 10, 20, 40, and
              80\% contrast (4 s duration) were used to test the hemodynamic
              response. Superposition of the obtained responses was performed
              to determine if the BOLD response is nonlinear. The nonlinear
              characteristics of the BOLD response were assessed using a
              Laplacian linear system model cascaded with a broadening
              function. Discrepancies between the model and the observed
              response provide an indirect measure of the nonlinearity of the

              subjects so the broadening function can be used to absorb
              nonlinearities in the response. The results show that visual
              stimulation under 4 s in duration and less than 40\% contrast

              resonance imaging (fMRI) response to auditory stimuli to be

              Using this paradigm we investigated the transient signal response
              to 100-ms tone bursts in trains of between 100 ms and 25.5 s in
              total duration. We have demonstrated that the fMRI response to
              such auditory stimuli is approximately linear for trains of 6 s
              and longer, but that shorter stimuli produce signals that are
              larger than might be expected from the response to the longer
              stimuli. This nonlinear behavior can be modeled if an adaptive
              response to each stimulus is assumed. A study using a novel
              paradigm was also performed in order to study the influence of
              scanner noise during fMRI experiments on the auditory system

              presence of scanner gradient noise, the modification being a
              small but significant increase (P<0.05) in the magnitude of the

              and a workspace framework",
  author   = "Dehaene, Stanislas and Naccache, Lionel",
  abstract = "This introductory chapter attempts to clarify the philosophical,
              empirical, and theoretical bases on which a cognitive
              neuroscience approach to consciousness can be founded. We isolate
              three major empirical observations that any theory of
              consciousness should incorporate, namely (1) a considerable
              amount of processing is possible without consciousness, (2)
              attention is a prerequisite of consciousness, and (3)
              consciousness is required for some specific cognitive tasks,
              including those that require durable information maintenance,
              novel combinations of operations, or the spontaneous generation
              of intentional behavior. We then propose a theoretical framework
              that synthesizes those facts: the hypothesis of a global neuronal
              workspace. This framework postulates that, at any given time,
              many modular cerebral networks are active in parallel and process
              information in an unconscious manner. An information becomes
              conscious, however, if the neural population that represents it
              is mobilized by top-down attentional amplification into a
              brain-scale state of coherent activity that involves many neurons
              distributed throughout the brain. The long-distance connectivity
              of these 'workspace neurons' can, when they are active for a
              minimal duration, make the information available to a variety of
              processes including perceptual categorization, long-term
              memorization, evaluation, and intentional action. We postulate
              that this global availability of information through the
              workspace is what we subjectively experience as a conscious
              state. A complete theory of consciousness should explain why some
              cognitive and cerebral representations can be permanently or
              temporarily inaccessible to consciousness, what is the range of
              possible conscious contents, how they map onto specific cerebral
              circuits, and whether a generic neuronal mechanism underlies all
              of them. We confront the workspace model with those issues and
              identify novel experimental predictions. Neurophysiological,
              anatomical, and brain-imaging data strongly argue for a major
              role of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and the areas that
              connect to them, in creating the postulated brain-scale
              workspace. Copyright ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",

              version of the global neuronal workspace model of consciousness,
              but there are residual confusions to be dissolved. In particular,
              theorists must resist the temptation to see global accessibility
              as the cause of consciousness (as if consciousness were some
              other, further condition); rather, it is consciousness. A useful
              metaphor for keeping this elusive idea in focus is that
              consciousness is rather like fame in the brain. It is not a
              privileged medium of representation, or an added property some
              states have; it is the very mutual accessibility that gives some
              informational states the powers that come with a subject's
              consciousness of that information. Like fame, consciousness is
              not a momentary condition, or a purely dispositional state, but

  title    = "An information integration theory of consciousness",
  author   = "Tononi, G",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Consciousness poses two main problems. The first is
              understanding the conditions that determine to what extent a
              system has conscious experience. For instance, why is our
              consciousness generated by certain parts of our brain, such as
              the thalamocortical system, and not by other parts, such as the
              cerebellum? And why are we conscious during wakefulness and much
              less so during dreamless sleep? The second problem is
              understanding the conditions that determine what kind of
              consciousness a system has. For example, why do specific parts of
              the brain contribute specific qualities to our conscious
              experience, such as vision and audition? PRESENTATION OF THE
              HYPOTHESIS: This paper presents a theory about what consciousness
              is and how it can be measured. According to the theory,
              consciousness corresponds to the capacity of a system to
              integrate information. This claim is motivated by two key
              phenomenological properties of consciousness: differentiation -
              the availability of a very large number of conscious experiences;
              and integration - the unity of each such experience. The theory
              states that the quantity of consciousness available to a system
              can be measured as the Phi value of a complex of elements. Phi is
              the amount of causally effective information that can be
              integrated across the informational weakest link of a subset of
              elements. A complex is a subset of elements with Phi>0 that is
              not part of a subset of higher Phi. The theory also claims that
              the quality of consciousness is determined by the informational
              relationships among the elements of a complex, which are
              specified by the values of effective information among them.
              Finally, each particular conscious experience is specified by the
              value, at any given time, of the variables mediating
              informational interactions among the elements of a complex.
              TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: The information integration theory
              accounts, in a principled manner, for several neurobiological
              observations concerning consciousness. As shown here, these
              include the association of consciousness with certain neural
              systems rather than with others; the fact that neural processes
              underlying consciousness can influence or be influenced by neural
              processes that remain unconscious; the reduction of consciousness
              during dreamless sleep and generalized seizures; and the time
              requirements on neural interactions that support consciousness.
              IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The theory entails that
              consciousness is a fundamental quantity, that it is graded, that
              it is present in infants and animals, and that it should be
              possible to build conscious artifacts.",

              system? The answer to this question remains enigmatic, not so
              much because of a lack of relevant data, but because of the lack
              of a conceptual framework with which to interpret the data. To
              this end, we developed Passive Frame Theory , a
              internally-coherent framework that, from an action-based
              perspective, synthesizes empirically supported hypotheses from
              diverse fields of investigation. The theory proposes that the
              primary function of consciousness is well-circumscribed, serving
              the somatic nervous system . Inside this system, consciousness
              serves as a frame that constrains and directs skeletal muscle
              output, thereby yielding adaptive behavior. The mechanism by
              which consciousness achieves this is more counterintuitive,
              passive, and `low level' than the kinds of functions that
              theorists have previously attributed to consciousness. Passive
              Frame Theory begins to illuminate (a) what consciousness
              contributes to nervous function, (b) how consciousness achieves
              this function, and (c) the neuroanatomical substrates of
              conscious processes. Our untraditional, action-based perspective
              focuses on olfaction instead of on vision and is descriptive

              than normative (construing processes in terms of how they should
              function). Passive Frame Theory begins to isolate the
              neuroanatomical, cognitive-mechanistic, and representational

              to experimental manipulations of conscious thought and behavioral
              dependent measures. Topics include mental practice and
              simulation, anticipation, planning, reflection and rehearsal,

              behavior is profound, extensive, adaptive, multifaceted, and
              empirically strong. However, conscious causation is often
              indirect and delayed, and it depends on interplay with
              unconscious processes. Consciousness seems especially useful for
              enabling behavior to be shaped by nonpresent factors and by
              social and cultural information, as well as for dealing with
              multiple competing options or impulses. It is plausible that

              formidable scientific challenge. Research on consciously
              penetrable conflicts (e.g., ``pain-for-gain'' scenarios) and
              impenetrable conflicts (as in the pupillary reflex,
              ventriloquism, and the McGurk effect [H. McGurk \& J. MacDonald,
              1976]) reveals that these states integrate diverse kinds of
              information to yield adaptive action. Supramodular interaction
              theory proposes that phenomenal states play an essential role in
              permitting interactions among supramodular response
              systems--agentic, independent, multimodal, information-processing
              structures defined by their concerns (e.g., instrumental action
              vs. certain bodily needs). Unlike unconscious processes (e.g.,
              pupillary reflex), these processes may conflict with skeletal
              muscle plans, as described by the principle of parallel responses
              into skeletal muscle (PRISM). Without phenomenal states, these

              projection, resulting in overlapped cortical representations of
              left and right visual hemifields. We show that in areas V1-V3
              this overlap is due to two co-located but non-interacting
              populations of neurons, each with a receptive field serving only
              one hemifield. Importantly, the two populations share the same
              local vascular control, resulting in a unique organization useful
              for quantifying the relationship between neural and fMRI BOLD
              responses without direct measurement of neural activity.
              Specifically, we can non-invasively double local neural responses
              by stimulating both neuronal populations with identical stimuli
              presented symmetrically across the vertical meridian to both
              visual hemifields, versus one population by stimulating in one
              hemifield. Measurements from a series of such doubling
              experiments show that the amplitude of BOLD response is
              proportional to approximately 0.5 power of the underlying neural
              response. Reanalyzing published data shows that this inferred

              coverage acquires most information from relevant locations
              determined by gaze fixation. We characterised patterns of
              fixational eye movements made by observers staring at synthetic
              scenes either freely (i.e. free exploration) or during a symmetry
              orientation discrimination task (i.e. active exploration).
              Stimuli could be mirror-symmetric or not. Both free and active
              exploration generated more saccades parallel to the axis of
              symmetry than along other orientations. Most saccades were small
              (<2deg) leaving the fovea within a 4-degree radius of fixation.
              The analysis of saccade dynamics showed that the observed
              parallel orientation selectivity emerged within 500ms of stimulus
              onset and persisted throughout the trials under both viewing

              this bias serves a functional role in which adjusted scene

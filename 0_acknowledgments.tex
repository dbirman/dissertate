This dissertation would not have been possible without the incredible patience of the (approximately) sixty volunteers who participated in my experiments. I am grateful for their willingness to see a ten-hour experiment as a challenging form of meditation and for the resolve of many of the participants to return over-and-over throughout my time at Stanford.
